<Content> This farm to table restaurant serves wonderful, healthy foods. I had the eggplant entree and can hardly wait to order it again - so delicious! They also have a great wine list.

<Content> I like Milo's. The good: Nice ambiance. The food is tasty. I especially enjoy the flat pizza with smoked salmon. Hot dang, it's good. The ok: The prices here are a tad high. The food could be even better. To sum up: they have some growing edges, but you'll have a good meal in a happy atmosphere.

<Content> My fianc and I were in town for an event and wanted to go out for a nice dinner. Sadly, this place was a disappointment, and at least we had one another as company to make a crummy restaurant fun. I will start with the absolute worst thing about this place...... THE SERVICE!! Seriously, who is in charge of hiring here? They really need to rethink their whole staff. I would seriously equate the service of this place to that of a Pizza Hut. The waiter took zero interest in us. I asked him if the risotto was vegetarian or if it was made with chicken stock... to which he literally said "Well, there is no meat in it and it comes with vegetables, so it is vegetarian." Sorry, this does not make it vegetarian. He did not even offer to go and ask the chef like any good waiter or waitress would do. Needless to say, I did not trust him and went with the mushroom ravioli instead. Looking back, I actually wish we were the type of people who could have not tipped at all, that is how bad it was. Moving on, the food. Overall, the quality of the food was very meh. As I said, I got the mushroom ravioli, and my fianc got the Berkshire pork chop wrapped in pepper bacon and garlic mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of onion rings. The onion rings were a joke. Literally, I would prefer the onion rings from Portilo's any day. I mean, I would even take Burger King onion rings over these. The ravioli was fine, definitely nothing special. This place seems to think it is way fancier than it actually is. My ravioli came out with carrots and green beans on top.... just because you make your food look "fancy" does not mean it is good quality. In fact, my extra dressings were luke warm, and I had to remove them from the dish because it completely threw off the flavor. I tried the gralic mashed potatoes, and they were also fine, probably the same quality you would get a buffet. I absolutely did not feel as though the quality of the food lived up to either the descriptions on the menu, nor was it worth the prices they were charging. I think we ended up paying $50 for everything here, when in reality, it should have been much less based on the quality. The decor is very eclectic. Definitely nothing special and it just felt like we were sitting down at a chain restaurant. Nothing about this place really seems to match up. They are really trying to be something that they are not. I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are looking for a nice evening.

<Content> Wow--I will not be returning to this place. I have eaten lunch there on two previous occasions, and while the service wasn't exceptional it wasn't bad either.I wish I could say the same about my first (and LAST!) dinner experience there! Clearly the managerial staff does not do an appropriate job of training the servers. Our poor server was clearly overwhelmed and just hadn't received much if any training. He was a sweet and sincere young man--I will always forgive service errors for waits in this situation. It isn't their fault if they have the desire to provide good service but are not provided with the proper tools by management.About 25 minutes after we were served our appetizer, we still hadn't been served our food. We got the attention of the manager and told her of the excessive ticket time and also told her that she needed to provide more training to her staff (the poor kid actually approached every table and said "you ok with just water?" ) and she laughed. I was serious.A few minutes later our food was delivered (incorrectly--wrong pizza for my son and wrong steak temp for my hubby, but at this point we didn't bother to bring it to anyone's attention). We had literally taken about two bites when the manager had the nerve to grab the poor server by the arm and physically drag him over to our table. She instructed me to "tell him what you just told me" and she stood there holding his elbow like he was a bad kid.I was incensed that she humiliated the poor kid in front of the whole restaurant and was aghast that she would put a guest in such a situation. It is HER job to coach her staff, not the guest's.We won't be back. And in the hours since our visit last night, I've heard from numerous friends who have had tremendously bad service there also and swear to never return.

<Content> Milo's was a bit of a letdown. I'd read the reviews on Yelp and was excited to check it out, but the food just did not deliver. I went there on a Saturday night with Arnab M: the place was pretty crowded but emptying as it was getting late, so we got a table right away. The food is American with various influences. I ordered one of the specials that day: duck breast with sauteed vegetables, mashed sweet potatoes and roasted pears (which by the way was almost identical to a dish I had at Escobar's in Champaign, see my review). I thought the duck was a little tough and overcooked, and the sides lacked flavor. Arnab had the Moroccan salmon: again the salmon was okay but the sides were disappointing. For the price (close to $20 per entree), I'm sure I can better dining options in town.Btw, the place is kind of hard to find. It's on NE corner of the Lincoln Square Mall, and it took us a little while to find it.

<Content> This place is WAY overpriced and the food reminds me of eating in a cafeteria. The only bright spot to my meal was the coleslaw. The decor is very eclectic to put it nicely but nothing that makes it stand out. Service was ok but the server ignored me at first until I had to flag her down to ask to order a drink. Not somewhere if ever eat again.

<Content> Five stars for my second to last visit here, three stars for my latest...I took my parents here about a year ago for dinner, and we had a great time. My mom loved her salad with 'strudel' on top, my dad had a steak, and I had the famous upside down pizza. (It's cooked upside down, then brought to the table and flipped over on your plate.) We also love love loved the smoked salmon and goat cheese bruschetta, so don't skip it!My latest trip was for brunch, where my mom and I split the spinach salad with strawberries and goat cheese and the grilled salmon pesto sandwich. The sandwich was fantastic, but the piece of salmon was very small. The salad was pretty good too, but priced like a dinner salad and sized like a side. The real differences in our experience were from the fact that the waitress kept forgetting things, from my brother's lemonade to an extra plate so we could share our food. However, even though we had to keep reminding her of these things, she was in remarkably good spirits the whole time and seemed genuinely apologetic for forgetting our requests.

<Content> Their seasonal menu is all your typical continental stuff: lamb, steak, duck... they're all good, but not blow your mind this is the best ever good. Another thing is that they don't seem tend to have a professional wait staff, sometimes making the service a little shoddy on some visits. However, I think this place is a lot better than other "fancier" places like Kennedy's or Silver Creek.What really makes this place shine are their specials. They prove that Milo's will explore different varieties of food, such as Thai with a seared tuna in a (I forget what kind) curry sauce or Cajun with corn meal fried soft shell crab over jambalaya. Every so often you'll see a recurring special (seared tuna with *blank* sauce), depending on what season it is. The problem is that their specials are sometimes hit or miss, but the fact that they try so many different things is refreshing.This place is definitely a must try in Champaign-Urbana.Some general things to look for in their menu: So after a while you'll notice that they tend to have some things prepared just a bit differently, but involve some of the same basic cooking techniques. So despite the fact that you may not see the exact same dish on subsequent visits, you can always count on certain things having the same solid quality:Rack of Lamb: Pretty good and tasty. However it is a bit on the chewy side.Steaks: Whether it's a filet, ribeye, or strip, they come nicely charbroiled. This is a good bet if you're a fan of steaks.Seared tuna : Regardless of what sauce they serve this in, if they're serving seared tuna? GET IT.Pan seared scallops: They have these down to a science. Always delicious.A specific type of pizza... mushroom Duxelle Upside Down Pizza: This is just awesome. If you're lucky enough to see it on the menu, give it a try.

<Content> I will start my review off by admitting that when my girlfriend and I walked in here for dinner we probably took the average age in Milo's down by 35 years. But honestly, WHO CARES?!?!The food is good. The prices are very reasonable, the quality is high, and it tastes good. Milo's is not as interesting as Escobar's, among C-U's "nice" restaurants, it's probably not the most interesting of any of them. It kind of reminds me of a restaurant in a hotel in Florida, which SURPRISE would probably feature a weird mix of Southern, Asian, Italian and Mediterranean, served in a comfy, relaxed environment to a fairly senior crowd.Whatever. Come, eat, enjoy- knocking off stars cause it's got a lot of elderly guests is just silly.Last thing I'll say is get the lemonade. I know that's random, but I can't begin to articulate how good their lemonade is.

<Content> Just got back from Milo's. This is a small cozy place with a real local feel. The service was excellent. The food was quite good. I got a Cuban black bean and ham soup followed by a broiled salmon on rice with vegetables and mango. It was a quiet and homey place good for a conversation. Also, tonight (Wednesday) there were a lot of old women there.. which made it kind of cute =p.The location is really quite strange. While it is connected to the Lincoln Square Mall, the entrance is on outside (specifically the East side) of the mall. And wow I have to say that Mall is straaange to walk through.. nearly abandoned and oh so ugly.

<Content> ATMOSPHERE: Eclectic. The space is open, with tables lined up against the walls, and local artists portraits on the walls. It seems "airy" in the dining room, with enough windows and space to feel like you aren't crushed by a dinner rush. I rather enjoyed sitting by the window looking out at the pond in the back, though I found myself having to strain to do so because the windows are higher than the chairs. The one thing I will also note is the noise level. For some reason, although I didn't notice it really loud in the restaurant, we were unable to hear each other across a round table. It was really odd, and I can't say I've ever experienced it dining before. We had to strain to hear one another, maybe the table was too big, or sounds bounced off the walls causing an unecessary reverberation, but whatever it is it was unsettling, and made enjoying each other's company nearly impossible.FOOD: Fair. I had the springtime risotto with chicken, and while the flavors of the risotto were pretty good (me being a risotto snob), I was dissapointed when it came to the table. I ordered a RISOTTO dish (with a side of chicken, which I expected to be sliced over the top) - what I got was about 1/2 cup of risotto, and a whole char-broiled chicken breast squashing my risotto. I also got a random smattering of carrots and green beans that I didn't order and shouldn't have been included, given the veg in my dish. The risotto, while decently flavored, was slightly under. My children each had the kid's pizza, and these were really good, actually.They were hand made, nice crusts, good cheese to sauce ratio, and pleasantly flavored, not like the usual frozen tasteless slop that many other restaurants usually send out for kids. It made me happy to see that the chef was thoughtful about younger patrons, and I'd probably return based on that alone.SERVICE: Meh... our server was an older female with long white hair that she didn't pull back, leaving me to wonder how much of it got into the food on any given night. She was slow to take our order, and I felt like slow to bring the food, but otherwise pleasant enough, and did a good job of keeping up with water and drinks.VALUE: Fair enough. Again, I felt like the risotto was overpriced some given the portion size, but a little portioning could fix this. Expect to pay around $20 per plate for adults, and most everything else I saw looked fresh, nicely made, and probably worth it.

<Content> Milo's menu is short and sweet with many options to customize the meal to suit any taste or appetite. Every single entree looked good- it was difficult making a decision. The wild mushroom ravioli was mild and savory with a great cream sauce, and the perfect amount. The crab cake sandwich special was perfect in taste and texture. Everything that came to the table was perfect. I highly recommend Milo's.

<Content> We took a long walk with the dogweasel over to Milo's and had dinner there last night (Wednesday) and got a great meal at a reasonable(ish) price. I had the salad with the corn/bean topping, beets, tomatoes, pecorino cheese and mixed greens which was huge and very good. The dressing compliments this salad very well. The lady had a daily special cold yogurt peach soup which she enjoyed a lot, but which is not for everybody, including me. The complimentary bread was very good and featured a couple of different kinds, all good.For entrees, we had their Thai curry flavored Halibut (on special) and chicken, which came with rice and sauteed vegetables. They were both expertly cooked, pleasingly presented, and amply portioned. The tasty curry sauce was similar to a slightly spicy Panang, but was reduced to a perfect consistency for the dishes. We both had leftovers. Their outdoor patio is really nice and looks over a pond and prairie area (that will soon be development, so enjoy the view while it lasts). The decor inside is also nice with original local artwork on the walls.The folks there were really nice and service could not be better. They let us bring our dog and gave us no jazz when she was less than perfectly behaved. They have a very nice wine list which, although not that large, has some very good choices at eminently reasonable prices. The selection of wines by the glass is superior. They also have a good beer selection, including Krusovice, which is fast becoming a new fave of mine. All told, the bill was in the high $50s pretax, which is not stellar, but about right for Chambana.

<Content> I went here for my birthday/Christmas lunch. It wasn't packed. I had the salmon on French bread with pesto. Honestly, I could have made it better myself. The other three in my party had the hamburgers. No one complained about that. They had given us free muffins while we waited, and that was excellent. The fries were good and the homemade ketchup was alright. The broccolli slaw as a side was excellent. I wish there were more of it on the plate. I noticed they also do special dinners. Like a Christmas dinner and a New years eve dinner. The price of the meal for four was around $55 with tip. The menu didn't have many options. The decor was medicore. The tables were small. The place would be nice to go to on special occasions or on a date, but I wouldn't eat lunch there often.

<Content> My dad and I were very impressed with the new Milo's in Urbana. They got us in on a Friday night without reservations, and even though it got really busy as the night progressed, our waiter never hinted at needing the table, etc. He was very friendly, knowledgeable, and there without being overbearing. He was prompt with beverage refills as well, and had someone check in on our table when he was on break.We shared a crabcake appetizer, which was absolutely delicious. They came out still quite hot, and the outside was very crisp while maintaining a softer inside. The aioli on the side was great, and the plating very nice. We both had the salmon with winter vegetable puree for dinner. My dad and I are both seafood snobs, and the salmon was actually better than what we got on the east coast in October of last year.It is a little pricey, but the ambiance, friendly staff and excellent food make up for it. That being said... I go there when the parents are treating, not when I have to pay for myself.

<Content> My experience was positive. The salad with bacon, pecans, feta, tomatoes was good, although not needed with the southwestern chicken egg rolls I ordered. The egg rolls had good salad greens and salsa with it. Both of my friends ordered chicken salad in pineapple boats. Very creative, and I hear tastey. Good coffee as well. I paid $17.50 incl tax and a soft drink. The ages of people varied from 35-65. They have a small happy hour group. Nice environment. I saw people there I knew!

<Content> Absolutely atrocious.I chose this restaurant for my graduation dinner because I had heard wonderful things about it in the past. We called and made a reservation, and I was very excited.First strike: I called early in the day to make a reservation for 8 people at 6:30 PM. I called several minutes ahead of time as a courtesy to let them know we would be arriving shortly (because it was a Friday night and I wanted to know if they were on schedule). I reiterated our number of guests and the time. When we arrived, our table was set up for the wrong number of people, and the table they chose was completely impractical for the special needs of some of our guests (which were divulged over the phone both times). There were 5 other tables dining in the restaurant. FIVE. There was no reason, especially after my phone call, that this should have happened. We waited around for changes to be made, which took longer than it should have. However, since we're all human, I shrugged it off and got ready for my meal.Second strike: We ordered drinks, and I can safely say they were the worst drinks we've ever had. Not one person at our table enjoyed their cocktail; they were overpriced, contained almost no liquor, and were improperly mixed. We stuck to (very overpriced) beer for the rest of the night.Third strike: When it came time to order dinner, we asked the waiter about some of the items on the menu. He seemed to know what 3 of the dishes were, and when we asked him some opinion questions, it became obvious that he only told us to pick these dishes because he was able to pronounce their names. He had NO clue what he was talking about, and we decided to take our chances by ordering a variety of dishes. I also ordered the shrimp cake appetizer.Fourth strike: I waited for said appetizer for 40 minutes. In that time two more tables arrived, but three left. Our waiter did not offer refills or check on our table while we waited, and by the time my appetizer showed up, I was about to start eating the basket the bread arrived in. They came closer with my plate, I could hear angels singing, and as soon as they set it down I deflated. I had two silver dollar sized cakes with an extremely large amount of greens on my plate. My husband and I each got three bites between the two cakes, and they were very small bites. I paid $10 for this?Fifth strike: Our meals came out within 5 minutes of our appetizer (sigh), and again the portion sizes were disappointing. My steak was cooked appropriately, but it was the only one at the table that was cooked correctly. My husband ordered the lamb shank, and it was tough and poorly seasoned. My mother in law had the lasagna, which was cold. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my sister, who ordered roasted chicken.Between the poor service, the inability to honor our reservation properly, the awful drinks, the long waits, and the bad food, I'm amazed that this restaurant is so well reviewed. The amount we paid for this awful meal makes it twice as bad. I will definitely never be back to this restaurant. The fact that there were less than 10 occupied tables at what would normally be the dinner rush on a Friday night speaks volumes, and now I know why.

<Content> For sheer tastiness of the food, Milo's is one of my absolute favorites. I never knew I could love roast chicken until I had theirs (something with lemon and herbs, amazing). My wife loves the upside down pizza. The flourless chocolate cake is so smooth and silky, loved it. That staff is always really friendly and I just love the flavors here.The only thing I didn't love is the exposed feel of the tables in the dining room. I like a private booth more than a table in the open, but most of their tables feel like they are in the open. Maybe I'll request a table in the corner next time.If I had to pick one favorite restaurant in the Champaign/Urbana area, Milo's would probably be it.

I only had 6 ravioli, I guess because it was lunch. The food was fair, the prices were average. The decor was unremarkable. It does look out onto a pond which was nice. I looked at the dinner menu and the prices seemed a little high to me, based on how how the lunch went? I probably would not come back for dinner.

<Content> David S. wanted to try out Milo's since Champaign doesn't have a million places to try, and Milo's had good reviews. We got a little lost trying to find it because the entrance is sort of hidden on the eastern side of Lincoln Square, but on our way we discovered some sort of teenage rave in the works, sooo random... We even directed someone to it. WEIRD and laughable doesn't begin to describe the situation. I ordered the Moroccan/Israeli spicy salmon with couscous which wasn't bad but came with this gigantic couscous, almost like tapioca pearls. It wasn't bad at all, but David's duck special was mediocre at best. David ordered some red wine, I forget which one but it was pretty good. Their waitstaff are all really niceee, mainly older men, which I'm so not used to. That's middle America for you, eh?

<Content> We had been to Milo's at the old location and had some very good meals there. I loved the hummingbird cake. The food was special. Something must have happened when Milo's moved to its new location. We decided the year it moved to go for Thanksgiving dinner, which was our first time there. We had the worst holiday meal experience of our lives. Our reservation was not honored in a timely way. The kitchen was over an hour behind. A waitress told us the owner had been letting in people without reservations, trying to capture all the business possible. Since we had nowhere else to go, we stayed. The food was really underwhelming, just above cafeteria grade, from the turkey to the dessert -- which was too bad, since it was a set, limited option menu, which should have given the kitchen enough focus to do things well. Our family was very let down by the experience. We have never gone back.

My worst Thanksgiving meal ever was at Milo's, last year (the last time we will ever be going back to Milo's or Escobar). And back at their Lincoln Square Mall location, I learned that just because you like goat cheese does not mean you put it on everything.

<Content> What a great little secret in Urbana. I know that it is out of the way, though really Champaign Urbana is small so NOTHING is that out of the way, but I digress. I have been eating there for years, and I have always loved it. I love the new, not really that new but newer, location. Love that the outdoor seating is in the "back yard". It's nice to look at a lake and not a parking lot. The food is always consistent and delicious. It changes as the seasons do to include the freshest in season ingredients. It is classic American, but it is more then that. I have had a great steak, Duck cooked to perfection, great salad, and my personal favorite which is an upside down pizza with caramelized onions and bacon. BACON BACON BACON. Whoops. Sorry. I just LOVE bacon. But I'll stop.I also like that there is usually no wait to a shot wait at most. If there is a wait they have a bar, or there is a great wine bar next door to have a glass while you wait!I also know they do a lot of charity locally. I like that they are involved. Make the 7 minute drive to windsor and philo. You will be happy.

And the very well prepared, gourmet items on the menu. The salads are perfection. I have been here many times for lunch with co-workers and have yet to be disappointed. My only issue is the weirdness they have with credit/debit cards....they will take them, but only 1 person per table when its separate checks. So if you're planning on separate checks, bring cash.

<Content> I'm not sure what is going on here at Milo's lately, but.... it appears to have become a senior citizen hangout in the last 6 months or so. I went for Valentine's Day (again) this year and I noticed that there were quite a few seniors here. Big deal. Then I went there for Sunday brunch last weekend, and I swear to you, I was the youngest person in the packed place by a good 50 years. What has happened? Since when do senior citizens like to eat weird/fancy/crazy food? I thought older people liked boring food haha. Maybe I'm the one who needs to get with the times =)

<Content> The sisters who run this and the chef, Obdulio, are all very nice folks who run a restaurant that does what it does well. That is to say, cater to those who want relatively conservative, mostly American-influenced cuisine plated nicely and with good portion size. The space itself is pleasant enough, tucked in a corner of the now-decrepit Lincoln Square Mall. Indeed, it is one of the few things left drawing people to that retail albatross. Additionally, the place has been there for over 10 years, right around the time that several better quality restaurants started to assert themselves in the area. So, they have a loyal clientele by now. For food that is a little more adventurous by the same team, try Escobar's in downtown Champaign.

<Content> Lincoln Square Mall is dead but this place isn't. The place is small but has a cozy feel. Service is fairly nice. Lots of good things on the menu: lamb, steak, upside-down pizzas, etc. Dessert menu is fairly standard but they do have an assortment of teas served in single French presses. Price is good, too.

<Content> My parents were in town and wanted to treat me and my friend to a nice dinner, so we went to Milo's for dinner. It's located in this cute little building kinda out in the middle of an empty field, but everything inside the building is really nicely done. There're lots of bright paintings hung on the walls, and generally gives off the ambiance of a really nice sit-down dinner place where you can chat with friends over wine or bring a date.Servers were all very nice and prompt, and the portions were HUGE! I had their tilapia ($17), and they served one of the biggest pieces of fish I have ever seen. My dad ordered their pork porterhouse and also got a huge slab of meat. My mom's salmon and my friend's mushroom ravioli were a bit more normal sized. As for quality, everything was delicious. The tilapia was lemony, buttered, and breaded, and the fish was thin enough for all the flavoring to soak in but not thin enough to be anywhere near insubstantial. The vegetable risotto that accompanied it was delicious as well. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their food as well, though my father's hoisin porterhouse had a bit too much hoisin sauce slathered onto it, which made it saltier than it could have been.Overall, a very satisfying dinner for reasonable prices (probably an average $20 per entree). 4 stars for solid comfort food that's done well in a very nice setting. On a more random note, we noticed (or maybe this is just on Thursday nights...or maybe just that particular Thursday night) that the clientele consisted pretty much entirely of older Caucasian women, who would cast a couple of curious, innocuous glances our way throughout the evening (everyone in our party was Asian). We didn't mind though; my parents joked that maybe they thought we were celebrities =P

<Content> Their roasted red pepper and goat cheese strudel is the best salad I've ever had. I don't know what they put in the dressing, but it is wonderful. The items here are expensive, but the quality and service justifies the price. A great place for lunch and they do a really good job with carryout as well.

<Content> Had dinner there on Saturday evening. I've been there before but wanted to go again to refresh myself before a review. The place was relatively empty and we chose to sit outside on a beautiful night. Service was good, but, then again, there weren't many customers. We started with a brie in pastry. It was quite good but the platter had more greens on it than anything else. Would have preferred more of the brie. One dish we had was the Duck Breast. It was nicely cooked and the skin was just the right crispness. The orange sauce was great, accompanying vegetables were okay but the rice was bland. We also had the Lamb, which was also nicely cooked. The garlic potatoes were short on garlic, however. The prices are a bit too high for what one gets. It was, however, nice to sit outside.

<Content> Had dinner here with my husband and mom and sister visiting from out of town.As a starter I ordered the salad with a goat cheese strudel and herb vinaigrette. The dressing and strudel were excellent. For dinner I ordered the crab cakes with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were good, but I was disappointed in the crab cake. I was hoping for jumbo lump, or at least lump crab, but it seemed to be all backfin. The seasoning was ok, but overpowered the sweet and brininess of the crab. My husband ordered the duck breast- which was very good, as was the rack of lamb with port reduction my mother ordered. Service was good, but plates were timed poorly- the potatoes and accompanying sauces (for the duck and lamb) were cold, indicating that the dishes weren't plated properly. All in all, a good meal, but not amazing.Have since returned to Milo's for dinner. I ordered Chicken in Pesto Cream Sauce over Penne, my husband ordered the Crusted Tilapia w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a Side Veg. For starters we had salad and a salmon chowder. The chicken was very well cooked, but it was breaded and fried, which I think should have been mentioned on the menu- unless it's chicken parmesan, I assume chicken with pasta (esp w/ a cream sauce) will be grilled/sauteed. The flavor of the sauce was *excellent*- but the penne was overcooked. My husband's fish was well prepared, but he felt the batter was a bit on the bland side. It also did not look like Tilapia- it was a thick piece of fish, with big flakes, so I would have guessed it was cod, pollock, or hake- tilapia are thin fillets. The mashed potatoes weren't exceptional, but for a side, they were decent. The salmon chowder- more like a corn chowder with a BIT of salmon, was good, but not the best I've had. Again, our meal was very good, and certainly by C-U standards, great.... but I still wouldn't say the meal was exceptional.

<Content> I came here for a graduation dinner on the recommendation of a friend (who works here as a waitress so I took the rec with a grain of salt). I was pleasantly surprised. We got a window table with a great view of the water. The server was super friendly and on her rec I ordered the duck - which was delicious. It was cooked perfectly with the right trimmings. I wish I had discovered this place earlier, like before I moved out of Chambana...I recommend this place for a reasonable meal with a great atmosphere!

<Content> I didn't have high hopes. The decor was a bit like a fancy Denny's. However, while ordering I was pleased to hear that they made their Caesar dressing on site with raw egg and anchovy no less. It was good. However, my meal of Moroccan Spiked Salmon was disappointing. It tasted very generic. Yet, one of my co-diners had the Tilapia at it was great. It is off the beaten path and I probably wouldn't make a special trip. However, if you are there, enjoy your friends or family and have a nice meal.

<Content> We had brunch here and it was just ok. I had the Florentine Eggs Benedict.  It was tasty but the poached eggs were too well done (yolk not runny enough). The Hollandaise was not seasoned enough. Bacon was burnt. Split pea soup was interesting but ultimately not very satisfying.

<Content> This is a really charming place. I went for lunch and ordered the grilled salmon with pesto. It was very good but I could have eaten another order. For those of you that hate coconut, like myself, the chocolate chip muffins that they bring out is loaded with coconut. Nice ambience and a nice view.

<Content> Pretty much a non-Latin Escobars. (Same owners). Nice selection and good service. The burger I had wasn't as good as I would have expected for the price and class of restuarant. The other entrees looked pretty good and they didn't poopoo my toddler like I rather expected. But again, with the elf food. I want to be full when I leave.

<Content> We dined at Milo's again last night. Again it was because we were celebrating something positive in our lives, and again, we made the RIGHT choice.This time, I finally persuaded myself to try something besides the reliably awesome filet - and went instead for the stuffed Salmon. It was delicious! subtle creamy exquisite flavors (without cream I think). And I love that I can get my Caesar Salad with actual anchovies on top (and not just as ground up paste in the dressing).The service is slightly slow sometimes, but there weren't a ton of staff on hand, so they're all doing a little extra. It's hard to balance the staff numbers -- When we arrived, there were only about 2 other tables, but folks came in while we ate, and the service slowed down accordingly. However, the service was always gracious, and courteous. My husband had one of the upside down pizzas. I'm a convert -- it was awesome! who knew? How and why have I deprived myself for so very long.We finished up with the flourless chocolate cake. It just does NOT get better than that.I WILL be back.

<Content> First off let me start by saying that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the food we had here. It was very adequate in presentation and taste for the most part. The service was great, very attentive without being overbearing, kudos to that guy. Now I'm a guy in my mid thirties, my wife and I were out celebrating our anniversary and had always thought about going there but never did so I figured we'd finally do it to mark our special day. We had reservations but they were not necessary as the restaurant was maybe half to two-thirds full when we got there-anyway we were greeted and taken to our table right away (This was at 6:30 mind you). Our waited appeared, told us the specials, got our drinks ( I had a beer and my wife a sangria) and we took a look at the menu. While I admit I don't have the most cultured palette, I felt like this restaurant didn't know what it wanted to be. One the menu there are several seafood dishes, Mac and cheese (Which I have nothing against but it didn't fit with everything else), Pizza, and the lovely "Milo's Favorites" column which included Chicken Salad, a Cheeseburger, Country Fried Steak, and Pasta Primavera. The Entrees were all over the place as well. Two steak, one pork, 3 Seafood, a couple of pasta- All if them having their individual road to go down-Moroccan, Cajun, Italian, etc. My wife had the pan roasted chicken with thai curry sauce, jasmine rice, and seasonal vegetables. She it was good, but not outstanding. I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and season vegetables. I have a feeling this place does not a have a grill. Maybe it's just me, but if I have the opportunity to grill and size-able piece of meat, I'm going to. I feel like that lends itself to a lot of flavor. The chop was plenty juicy and I believe was pan seared and then finished off in the oven. It was topped with some sort of apple mixture. While it wasn't bad, I felt like it needed salt and overall more flavor. The potatoes were very good as were the vegetables. I guess the thing that bothered me the most was that I felt like I was eating at a hospital cafeteria (albeit a nice one). I certainly wouldn't classify this place as romantic as there is no place secluded in the restaurant. It's a big open room with some very plan looking tables and chairs. If anything I think I would put linen table cloths on for dinner and some wine glasses. Maybe build some booths or partitions...something. They have a very nice looking pond in the back, there's tons of potential, it's just as if the owner got to doing the dining room and ran out of money; bare minimum. The clientele was fine, however I'm guessing the average age of folks there was 65 on a Saturday night and when we departed around 7:30 there hadn't been anyone come in for the past 20 minutes or so. If I were the restaurant owner I might be a tad concerned. I certainly believe this place is a decent place to eat but atmosphere is lacking.

<Content> Last night was my first visit to Milo's after hearing good things about it. I must admit, I was a bit disappointed - that's why I only gave Milo's 2 stars. I ordered the spinach salad and it was pretty good. Nothing special. I also ordered the flat pizza with pesto, goat cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. It was good, but a bit greasy. My husband ordered the soup and I'm sorry I can't remember the name of it, but it was red and spicy - very good -probably the best of all we ordered. I would definitely order it myself. He also had their vegetarian lasagna. It tasted like it was a Mexican lasagna and the flavors didn't seem to go together. My son had the salmon. It was a small piece of salmon, but he said it tasted good. He didn't eat the vegetables because they were loaded with sauce. I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of ambiance. I was expecting a really nicely decorated restaurant. The tables and chairs look like they belong in Arby's. There were no booths. No privacy. There were a lot of empty tables, yet we were seated right next to another couple. We could hear most of their conversation. I wasn't wowed by Milo's at all. Not sure if I'll go back any time soon.

<Content> Milo's was one place on my list of restaurants that I wanted to visit before I left the C-U area. I went on a Wednesday night with five friends without a reservation, and we definitely didn't need one - the restaurant was almost empty and we were seated quickly at a table. We were brought a basket of bread which had an assortment of breads and muffins, and our table requested more muffins as they were DELICIOUS. After hearing about their specialty upside-down pizzas, I wanted to try one and shared the caramelized onion, blue cheese and bacon (ordered and correctly served without bacon) pizza and the mushroom ravioli with a friend. Both were delicious, and the ravioli was served with fresh steamed summer vegetables on top which was a nice surprise. My starter of a mixed greens salad with basil vinaigrette was perfect. The service was good and none of our water glasses were left empty. The only drawback would be that their menu doesn't have the biggest selection, but everyone I went with was able to find something to eat and enjoy it. Also, they have strange policies about no more than two credit cards per table and a fee for splitting plates. Overall, I'm glad I was able to visit this restaurant, and the drive over to its location was worth it.

<Content> We had high hopes for this place and were sorely disappointed. The decor is nice, the setting is relaxing. It overlooks a small pond and has some outdoor seating. However, the food and service are very mediocre. Nothing special or memorable here at all. Mediocre food would have even been ok if the prices reflected that. Way overpriced for what you get.

<Content> I've eaten at many great...and not so great restaurants in the USA and europe. Milo's can stand with any of the good ones. It's food is honest, interesting and delicious-all without being pretentious. The portion sizes are large (so it's really two meals), the prices are extremely reasonable and the place is casual. I understand that the owner's also own a nearby bakery. THAT explains their wonderful bread selection that you may nosh on while waiting for your meal. The service has always been great, even when the place is packed, which is often.
