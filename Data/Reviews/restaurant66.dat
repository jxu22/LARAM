<Content> I just found my new favorite pizza joint. Better than papa dels! I ordered the chicago style which i have to say is usually not my favorite, i prefer thin crust. That said every now and again i have a hankering for chicago style and this one didn't disappoint. What i don't like about chicago style is its often too doughy. when i eat papa dels its like chewing on an undercooked dough ball and a lot of it. not good. Amano's crust however was fantastic, i ate every bite, not doughy at all with a nice "pull" you get from well crafted pizza dough. Nothing is more important than a great crust and they nailed it. Yes, sauce is important too and they have Great sauce, spice, great sausage (though papa dels sausage is hard to beat), just a really well balance pizza which isn't easy on a chicago style. Family run, very clean, super friendly and fairly priced, go ahead eat great pizza! As this was my first visit i'll have to update when i get a chance to try their thin crust. cant wait!

<Content> Wow, another hidden gem of deep dish pizza in the C-U area!After nearly a 2 hour wait for delivery at Papa Del's we tried to find an alternative for our deep dish delivery craving on a Saturday. Well, mission: accomplished!Delivery time was less than an hour from ordering and I do believe it cost less than Papa Del's for a similar sized pie.We got sausage and pepperoni on ours and my only complaint was that there wasn't very much of either of these on the pizza, especially pepperoni. Although they were definitely not omitted, I'm not subtracting stars for that reason because I usually like my pizza very plain (cheese only) so it didn't matter to me.We thought the sauce was a bit more liquidy than most Chicago style pizzas but actually realized this was a good thing because it dripped into the crust and cheese making it more flavorful.It was loaded with wonderful cheese! Stringly, hot, gooey and awesome cheese! Yum!Also noteworthy was the crust, it was not too thick and not too thin, as sometimes deep dish can be. Overall we were pretty satisfied with our second deep dish delivery in the C-U area and I would definitely like to try some of Amano's other items as well.Just because Amano's isn't right in Campustown doesn't mean it isn't worth getting!I will order again!

<Content> Way to go Yelpers! I discovered this fantastic place because of you all. The pizza is a bit pricey but well worth the money. I was a bit thrown off by seeing a huge rack full of what I thing was canned sauce but that may have been the best thing ever to come out of a can this side of beer! I ordered a 14' pepperoni, sausage, bacon, onion, and black olive deep dish pie and wasn't disappointed. I could have done some cheap weight lifting with how heavy this monstrosity of deciduousness. All of the toppings tasted fresh and the sausage was especially amazing. I think my taste buds got pleasures to the point where it might have been sexual...I may have issues too but who knows? Why 4 stars? Well the first slight problem I had was that they offer free spices such as garlic, salt, pepper, and a whole host of others that I wish they would have told me about over the phone as I would have liked said spices to be heated with the pizza for better integration. The other slight slip is that my pizza came unsliced. This meant that I was made to suffer from unbearable hunger until I was able to squire a pizza slicer. It was as if the pizza was playing with my emotions. Both small issues but combined they cost a star because 5 stars are awarded for complete perfection. Awesome grub though and I love to support mom and pop businesses!

<Content> As a native Chicagoan I can say without question, this pizza is amazing. I am VERY picky about my deep dish pizza and this hits what I crave on every mark. The sauce is lovely and not too sweet, the toppings are wonderful (see: fresh portabello mushrooms), and the crust makes me think of home.The price is also right and the sampling of non-pizza plates is good. Please please please support Amano's. It's deserving of the attentionI will be returning many times I can promise that

<Content> Great pizza and friendly service make Amano's a clear choice in Chicago style pizzas in Champaign-Urbana. The sauce has great flavor and the crust is perfect and not too thick. I ordered a sausage and mushroom and the sausage pieces were a perfect size. You can tell they really care about the quality of their pizzas.This is a much better pizza than the over-hyped Papa Del's. If you're in the mood for Chicago style stuffed pizza give Amano's a try.

<Content> People always say that Papa Del's is where the stuffed pizza is at. NO WAY. Amano's is the best here. It's not as doughy and better seasoned. Trust me. Next time you feel like you want Papa Del's, give this a shot.

<Content> Wonderful pizza, wonderful people. If you are a Chicago native and like stuffed pizza, order here. If you are not a Chicago native and don't know wtf a stuffed pizza is, order from here. Know that you will be waiting 40 minutes. They make it when you call, none sitting around. I'd pick it up, the drivers will go just about anywhere but you're adding on delivery time that you could be spending eating fresh hot pizza. This is not a sit down place, its counter only, but the owners are pleasant and chatty, the place spotless, and the pizza is awesome. Try the dessert pizza too.
