<Content> I was walking around the mall Christmas shopping when I was struck with a sudden hunger. While walking around trying to decide where to eat a nice gentleman with a sample tray walked up to me and had me try one of every sample they had.After sampling the Orange chicken, the teriyaki chicken and the bourbon chicken I decided to get a triple entree meal from Kato's.It was delicious, and they did not skimp on portion sizes like some places o it was mounded on my plate and was freshly made.the only complaint would be that the fried rice was rather bland and flavorless.

<Content> I felt compelled to write an update on my latest visit. The chicken was awful! It had a funny taste to it. I can't seem to put my finger on it. It did not taste like chicken nor did it look like chicken. I felt it was way overpriced for what I got. I will avoid from now on.

<Content> I never had any kind of Asian or chines kind of food .One Saturday we walked around in the mall and they gave out samples and I fell in love with Kato's chicken and they gave you two big sides ,lots of food .The food is reasonably priced.
