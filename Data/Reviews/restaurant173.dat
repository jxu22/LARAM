<Content> Had the Black Angus Club and was happy with my choice. The food was good and the sweet tea is as good as any I've had. I only had a couple of negatives I felt I should bring up. 1. The cashier reminded me of Aubrey Plaza's character, April, in Parks and Rec.2. It took my coworker 15 minutes to get his lunch after they forgot his order. They quickly fixed the problem and offered him a free cookie to make things right. I would definitely go back. I won't call it a must go but if you're looking for a solid sandwich and one is nearby check it out.

<Content> After driving since midnight, I stopped here at 11a for lunch. I ordered tomato bisque and half a spud to go. I asked for no sour cream with the spud. Not only did they not give me any butter for my potato, they also didn't give me a freaking spoon for my soup. I didn't check my bag before leaving the restaurant, as I normally only have to do that at McDonald's. So, because I don't keep spare spoons in my car, I had to pour my bisque on top of my potato in order to eat it. I also stopped in the restroom on my way out, and there was zero toilet paper in the stall I used. The restaurant opened 30 minutes before I arrived, so I'm guessing someone just didn't feel like checking the restrooms before the restaurant opened. I could understand if it was after the lunch rush or in the evening, but this was 30 minutes after opening. Thanks for killing my uber excitement to eat here.

<Content> Thought I would give them another shot after a few bad experiences years ago. I can't figure out why they are still in business! The prices are too damn high considering the quality and size of the food items with the exception of the 1 gallon cups they use. Tried a choose 2 with a bacon & cheese potato and a French Dip. I asked if the potato would melted shredded cheese or liquid cheese and she said liquid. It was definitely a very skimpy portion of melted and re-hardened shredded cheese. I included a photo of it for your opinion. Should've taken a photo of the tiny sandwich too. It was about 4 inches and had a small pile of beef in the very center of the bread. I paid $7 for this sad little meal. Wendy's bacon & Cheese potato is the same size or larger with actual melted liquid cheese and twice as much bacon for $1.99. Throw in a Jr. cheeseburger and you would get a much better meal at half the price. Writing this place off for good now!

<Content> It's a pretty good chain deli. Sandwiches are good depending on what you get. I like the roast beef and cheddar and the Italian. Potato salad is very good as are the soups.My only complaint is the price of the food. You pay for more than you get.

<Content> McAllister's will receive 4 stars for multiple reasons. Is it a true deli? No. But once you realize that and understand that it is simply a fast food place that serves deli sandwiches, soups and salads you come to appreciate it. In this part of town there aren't many options to eat something quick and not have it be greasy. McAllister's would not be 4 stars if surrounded by other awesome food locations (probably 3 stars then), but don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten there (salads and sandwiches).People giving this 2 stars or lower are crazy and just had the wrong expectations....

<Content> This place has been so desolate every time I've been here. The food is not the best either. They have a ton of menu options which is really the best part. The cookie was good too, but overall, nothing special.

<Content> The equivalent of a Panera Bread, Au Pain or Atlanta Bread Company. Nothing particularly great or awful. They herd you in and out. The food is filling in a high-carb kind of way but not fulfilling in a savory way.It's basically a fast-food deli. It is NOT an authentic deli IMHO by any stretch of the imagination.

<Content> I was very disappointed with my order today. In the past I have ordered the wrap and it was decent although today I had the French dip and it was awful. The best thing about the meal was come zero. I'll give them one more chance and update review next time.

<Content> This place gets 3.5 stars from me.So I went to McAlister's Deli pretty excited because the word deli was involved... well... I would hardly call it a deli. Deli's are so much more than just a place that has sandwiches!I ended up ordering the baked potato with veggie chili and some pepperjack cheese with jalapenos on top. It must have been two baked potatoes opened up because this thing took up the whole to go box that it was in. I must say, it was pretty good... nothing I couldn't make at home but hey.. we all get lazy sometimes.At first I was thinking...wow... that's a lot for a baked potato... but this thing was so huge that it was totally worth it. I would suggest this place... but if you're expecting some amazing pastrami sandwich with the most delicious pickles ever... you will be disappointed.

<Content> I felt like a salad, and that's rare. I got the special salad, with chicken, almonds, and Gorgonzola. The dressing was shallot something. It was dull, but I ate it. The tea is good, and that's what drew me in to try the place. I agree, the prices for what you got is high. I might try it again when I come back in the area, the baked potatoes looked good.

<Content> Expensive for dinky portions. Beware the soup and salad "deal" unless you brought a microscope. My pastrami was still cool - unevenly toasted and really wasn't great pastrami either.  The sweet tea is ok, but not orgasm inducing as rumored. The bag of chips that accompanies a sandwich is suspiciously not presented to you but rather you get the chips you request on the side - seemed like less than come in the standard single serving bags displayed at the counter. Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought it was suspect.And worst of all, if you have a bad experience like I did, the comment cards expect you to affix postage. I'm not going to invest any money telling them how to improve their overpriced chain restaurant.

<Content> The deal here is the half combos. The Savannah salad is pretty tasty minus the test-tube chicken. It has gorgonzola cheese, lots of tart cranberries, cucumbers, pecans and chopped tomatoes. Good size for a half portion. My other half is always the chicken salad and croissant. It's not huge but I walk out of there satisfied. My mom loves the baked potato with the angus steak junk. I could only imagine how many calories, sodium and fat two potatoes have but my mom didn't seem to mind. Guarantee when she is down here that's were we'll stop. The tea is pretty tasty too.

<Content> I went with a couple friends to McAlister's for dinner last night. It was my second trip there, and I have to say that "A-OK" is the perfect term to describe my feelings about it. If there were half-stars, I'd give it 3.5. I got the two-item combo ($6.95?), which gives you a choice of two items: soup, half-salad, half-sandwich or half-potato. I got the chef salad and the cheesy potato. Everything was good. I liked my potato, and the salad was also tasty. The portions were decent for the price. The whole potatoes must be gigantic, because the "half" order was huge. I also got a half-and-half iced tea (half-sweetened, half-unsweetened). That was pretty awesome, I'll admit. It's a huge cup for around $2, and we regularly had a staff member come by and offer to clear plates and give refills. Service here seems to really vary. I remember last time that the cashier was fairly impatient and huffy when I asked a question about the menu. Last night, our service was good - not fantastic, but solid. They did bring out the wrong combo at first, but it was a quick fix. I guess maybe it's my fault that I only feel mediocre about McAlister's. If I loved pastrami sandwiches, or ordered something besides a boring salad and potato, I might give it four stars. It really is a decent place for a quick, hearty meal. Still, it's the kind of place I'd go only if I were 'in the area' - doesn't warrant a special trip out of my way.

<Content> Horrible service for over priced food. Tonight was a joke. My father never got his food, and asked for his money back; the guy couldn't have cared less and never offered an apology or tried to make it right. We sat at our table and watched the staff walk around aimlessly while food sat on the ledge ready for serving for far too long. My 'iced tea' was hot, and they wouldn't give me a re-fill. I'll never go back, and would never recommend to anyone I know.

<Content> Normally a great spot for lunch, but not today. We ordered 4 sandmiches, chips & drinks at 12:51pm and did not get our food until 1:20pm! Really...almost 30min for 4 cold sandwichs. Did I mention that 3 of the sandwichs were supposed to be hot & we had to ask for the "dip" for the French dip? Very disappointing.

<Content> I ate there on 11/19/2012 because I was in the area, and the store had deli in its name. I ordered the New Yorker, and combo sandwich of corned beef, pastrami and cheese on toasted rye. If they called this a New Yorker in NYC, they would be laughed at and/or fined for false advertising. The sandwich was small, maybe 5 oz. of meat and cheese. The rye bread was typical Midwest soft, and the meat was tasteless. I paid $9.81 for the sandwich, chips, and iced tea. Never again.

<Content> This deli opened up relatively recently in Champaign, and I finally decided to give it a shot as we were driving from the mall to the North Prospect shopping district. The drinks are huge - I had a lemonade and it was great, I hear the sweet tea is good too. For lunch I had the pastrami on rye and I was pretty impressed. A lot of people make the pastrami way too peppery, but this was just right - and they gave you quite a bit of it. My husband had a grilled chicken club sandwich, and I liked it even more than the pastrami! The pickles are good on the side, and my husband raved about the mashed potatoes. Great service too!

<Content> 5/31/2010 I seriously have to give this a star???Highly over-rated and highly over-priced, but their management style is what annoys me the most. They have this thing about filling your cup with ice to overflowing, which I understand from a dollars and cents level, but it's still annoying. So I ask for easy ice and am given TWO cubes. WHATEVER! We ordered three meals recently and two were delivered to the table. Shortly the third was put in the window to be brought out, and while a couple people had it in their hands, they always put it back and went in another direction. So there it sat until we were finished eating at which time we asked for money back on the meal never delivered. They took their sweet time doing that as well, offered no option of making it to go, offered no free meal coupon to make things right, no apology for screwing up, and no eye contact. I'm always just amazed at the way they treat people when I go there, but I won't be going there anymore.

<Content> This is one of my favorite places to eat. Although it's a little pricey, I have to admit that the customer service is really good. I had a problem with some food, emailed the manager, got a prompt response and received a comp-ed meal. That wasn't even what I wanted, I just wanted to make sure that my order was correct the next time I went in. I will warn you, if you order to-go, make sure to check your bag before you leave. I have been known to get back to my destination and realize that I didn't have the dressing with my salad or the butter or anything for my potato. Overall, a great place to eat.
