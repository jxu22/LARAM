<Content> This Chipotle looks like any other, serving up your fresh, stereotypical Mexican cuisine. Service: The workers here are a bit terse and pretty inefficient compared to the Chipotles in Chicago. But then again, there is much higher traffic in Chicago... Thank goodness I didn't come when school already started...!Food: The quality here is just as good as any other Chipotle :)

<Content> Champaign chipotle serves decent food but it has two strikes against it.1. The line for this restaurant borders on the absurd. I've seen times where the line wraps around the restaurant then out the door. I've even seen people lining up before the restaurant has even opened. If you like waiting in long lines to eat passable mexican food then this is the place for you.2. The portions tend to be on the skimpy side. I've been to chipotles across the country, and I have noticed that this one gives the smallest portions. It doesn't really matter for the management because the demand they have is abusrd, but it us upsetting. Chipotle isnt cheap for that they provide.If you have time, I'd recommend going to Maize instead. You still have to wait in an crazy line, but the food will actually be worth the wait and walk.

<Content> One of my peers is a native of Mexico and I asked him what he really felt about this place. His exact words were "It's just like Taco Bell." It's nice to get a native's perspective on our Americanized Mexican food. I gotta say that the food is fairly delicious and filling though but it does cost a bit too much for it.

<Content> Okay, so I know it's owned by McDonald's, and after watching Super Size Me, I will never eat at that place again. But wow, I don't care if it's going to clog the crap out of my arteries, I LOVE CHIPOTLE. Then after being in Florida for school for so long, my obsession with Chipotle became clear. Their chicken fajita burritos and their salsa are just soo good! It's also nice that you're able to get a Corona on the side if you want. MMmmm.UPDATE!Melissa M right below me just informed me that McDonalds no longer owns Chipotle. EAT UP!

<Content> I love the fact that the prices are about the same no matter if you're getting three tacos, burrito, or burrito bowl. It's not authentic Mexican food.. but it surely tastes good. I also like how they don't charge more for extra peppers and onions. I do think you are a bit mislead though.. you might think you may be eating healthy.. but one visit to their website and you learn that you eat about 1000 calories per burrito. So.. if you're looking to eat healthy, I definetely wouldn't eat here.The seating is a bit limited here.. they have some seats upstairs. I don't like how they don't really clean off the tables.. so it may require some self service. But I love the fact they use Tabasco sauce.

<Content> A popular lunch and dinner place with the campus crowd, there is almost always a line of some sort at Chipotle. Unfortunately, the line is pretty slow. It's not uncommon to see the line backed up, wrapping around some of the tables, because of one or two orders that seemed to have thrown off the staff. If you are the type to plan ahead, order online, so you can just walk up to the pick up register and get your food almost immediately. It is also quite common to have to repeat yourself when ordering; this is largely due to the noise level inside during lunch and dinner hours.Chipotle has burritos, bowls, salads, and tacos (and more on a secret menu). Just about everyone gets a burrito or a bowl and you're likely to get more for your money with those two. It's easy for a burrito to get over packed if you're the type to get everything on it, so you might want to opt for a bowl instead. The chicken is arguably the best meat option here. The steak is chewy, the barbacoa is boring, and the carnitas are dry and under spiced. A pork travesty. Veggies (green peppers and onions) are free, but they won't ask if you want it, you'll have to be explicit.Note that the food here is not true mexican, but very Americanized.Chips, salsa, and guac here are all good. Note that if you want guac on your burrito or bowl, it costs extra.They don't have Dr. Pepper in the soda fountain. :(What I've said so far might not seem deserving of a 4 star rating, but the reason this place is 4 stars is because of the price. A little less than $7 bucks gets you a HUGE amount of food.

<Content> Champaign Chipotle sucks. Honestly, I love Chipotle. I've had it in numerous places, always enjoyed a big juicy burrito, but this one... The worst of the worst. My burrito was half-sized, and most of the ingredients were overhelmed by rice and beans. Barbacoa was tough and dry... Rice was dry too, Corn was pale and weird. Pretty much all of the ingredients tasted different!Never again.

<Content> Ok - it's no El Charro. But if I had to pick a chain restaurant on campus, I'd go with Chipotle. Especially now that Chipotle isn't owned by McDonald's anymore - I feel better about endorsing them. Their veggie burrito bowls are very filling and the majority of the ingredients are organic, naturally raised, sustainable, hormone free and sometimes, even locally grown! It is truly Food With Integrity, like their ads claim. And anyone who goes to Qdoba (greasy barf) is out of their mind.

<Content> Let me start this off by saying I LOVE Chipotle. I could eat it everyday if I could afford that. I've been to them in Champaign/Chicago/etc. They're great and deserve five stars.The problem with this Chipotle in particular- THE LINE. Holy hell. Everytime I would think to myself, "I want Chipotle" I'd look in and see a line wrapping around the building. Of course I waited in it, but it took forever. This isn't a one time occuring thing either- there is always a LINE. I think it's because of the online orders, backing everything up. Either way, the food and everything is still excellent, it's just a long wait.

<Content> I was a late bloomer when it came to Chipotle, and I now love it. I regret not eating it sooner. I wish they had more than one location, because if you don't live close to it and don't feel like going on campus at that certain time, you're out of luck. But it's across from an Urban Outfitters, double trouble.I'm a fan of the guacamole, and I think the chips are delicious. My weapon of choice is a chicken burrito, but the tortillas are a little too thin. Maybe my add-ons are just too much, but the thin tortilla never makes it to the end in one piece. Then everything kinda turns into a clusterfuck. But nonetheless, it's very tasty. Line can be long but usually moves fast, friendly staff. Two thumbs way up, holiday fun for the whole family.

<Content> Chipotle may not be authentic Mexican, but it does set itself apart from other chains. The primary reason to go to Chipotle is the quality of the ingredients. Niman Ranch pork is ten times more juicy and delectable than the factory farmed version. It's also much more humanely raised and ecologically friendly. Chipotle braises the pork with pepper and other mild spices and the tender and flavorful result is what keeps me coming back all the time. There are lots of other options ranging from chicken to vegetarian, but in my opinion the pork is really the best. This location sometimes will give you a discount if you order just meat/cheese/rice and sometimes not...it's rather bizarre, but I think it depends on if the manager is around or not. I keep my receipts as a rather amusing record of how many times I have gotten the "Ilini secret special."It's quite expensive as "fast food" goes and it gets crowded. I usually take mine to go, since every Chipotle I've visited has had a harried atmosphere that makes dining in unpleasant...but even if it upscale fast food, it's still fast food, so that's what I expect.

<Content> Chipotle is delicious. Way better and fresher than qdoba, but they also don't have as much variety (I'd go for fresher and better over variety any day). Burritos run about $6.50-$7, plus you can go for the upsell with guac, chips, and a drink and end up with a ~$12 bill, which is a little much for a meal in a fast casual restaurant. The burritos are pretty big, but I can't say that I'm completely full after them, however with the calorie count, I really shouldn't complain. Biggest downside to this location is that it's almost always busy; you can expect a 10-30 minute wait during lunch and dinner periods, and sometimes just randomly throughout the day. Also, they aren't open all that late, so you can't satisfy those late night munchies with a Chipotle burrito :-(

<Content> I really don't understand all the guilt in liking Chipotle! If you like it, you like it. Frankly I'd take a tasty inauthentic chain restaurant burrito over some of the local flavorless grease bombs any day. I think the success of Chipotle is down to their very focused menu. They only serve burritos, salads and chips. They have chosen a narrow scope and do it well.Like most chain restaurants, it usually tastes better the when they are busier. I have gone at off-times and had less-than fresh ingredients served to me. Frankly though if they start scraping the bottom of the container of meat I imagine you could politely ask to wait for a fresh batch.I'm not a fan of grease and I enjoy the fact that the meat seems lean but juicy. That way grease isn't squirting all over your plate as you attempt to eat the burrito. Their chips are generally very fresh tasting and warm. They have just the right amount of salt. I'd recommend the guacamole as it's certainly better than I ever imagined it could be.There are better sit-down restaurants to eat Mexican in town. But if you need something quick to eat and are near campus this is a great choice over somewhere like Taco Bell.

<Content> Visited here for the first time a few days ago. I've been to Qdoba many times over the years, but had always avoided Chipotle due to the much longer waits. I generally avoid campus eateries when students are here, but since it was much less crowded on campus a friend of mine and I decided to take advantage.I wanted to get a chicken burrito (as did my friend), but we were told it would be at least an additional 5 minute wait, so my friend chose steak and I decided to try the carnitas. I was expecting something very flavorful, but I felt it was rather bland. I chose black beans, medium salsa (wish I had gone with hot now, because medium had no heat or taste at all), and cheese. Perhaps it would have been better with chicken, but I would have taken a steak queso burrito from Qdoba any day. I will probably give it another chance if I have the urge to go on campus, but the hype I had heard before going outweighed my actual experience. Extremely loud, but you kinda expect that on campus.

<Content> Why the fuck would I review Chipotle, a delicious but slightly generic burrito chain? I had to echo the chorus whom can't help but laugh at the portion sizes. Of course some may say we're just being "Fat Americans," but I love the bang-for-my-buck gut bombs that Chipotle is famous for. The burritos at this location simply seem like a sample size compared to superior other locations; the employees seem to give less of a damn than any other fast food location in the area. That's a great summation of this Chipotle.

<Content> Gimme a break, this is an imitation Mexican restaurant run by McDonalds. I'm from Urbana and I live in a very competitive place for mexican food, San Diego, CA. The best thing that can be said about the food is, (a) Its not expensive for the amount you get, (b) It's unlikely to cause indigestion, and (c) If you've never tried mexican before, this won't turn you away forever.Otherwise, compared to many other mexican fast-food restaurants, this one is highly forgettable. Example : L.S. (CA West Coast), much better, a 5-star fast-food mexican restaurant. Example : R. (National), much better, a little pricier than the one above and salsas not as good, a 4-star fast-food mexican restaurant, and a publically traded company. Example : T.B. (National). Ok, it's not really mexican, but I enjoy their "imaginary" mexican creations, such as the 7-layer burrito and their chalupas, 3 stars.

<Content> When I visited this Chipotle most recently, it was lunchtime and the staff seemed stressed. There was a very large fax order and the crew was trying to get that order made, as well as tend to the long line of people. I had to wait for a while, and even when I was first in line (and waiting for the fax burritos to be made) no one greeted me, or apologized for the delay. They ignored the lengthening line as they made the fax order. When they were able to start my tacos, I noticed that all the food looked fine, really delicious, but I thought that the portion size of the meat was less than usual. I eat at a Chipotle at least once a week, and most frequently I have been a customer of the West Lafayette, Indiana or Valparaiso, Indiana stores. I used to live a half-block from the West Lafayette store, so for close to a year it was probably my favorite place to run out to eat. So, I think I know what the portion size should look like. I assumed that the workers were rushing and not being careful, so I spoke up and asked for the right portion size because what I was given looked "short." The crew member got defensive and said that if I wanted more, I would be charged for double meat. I didn't want, nor ask for, double meat, just the right or "usual" portion size. He then said he had to ask his manager. The manager agreed to give me slightly more (which was probably getting close to the right amount), which could have resolved the problem entirely if she had done so with a smile. But instead, she had to "be right" and she verbally pointed out to me that the way my tacos had originally been served was correct and that I was wrong for saying it wasn't. She even said something about the number of ounces it is supposed to be (but she didn't have any way to really measure this other than eyeballing it.)All I wanted was probably 25 or 50 cents of ingredients to make it right (and the ingredients I didn't select, like cheese and sour cream, would have made up the cost to the company, on the whole.) So instead of delighting me with a smile and a quick resolution to this issue, the manager made a choice to verbally argue with me (after I had waited a good 5-10 minutes in line), and leave me displeased with both the food and especially the customer service.Chipotle, you're supposed to leave the customer relaxed, happy, and satisfied -- not upset.

<Content> Recently, the prices at this location have arbitrarily climbed (while the prices at other locations have remained static), and customer service has significantly decreased. The burritos, which were already smaller than usual at this location, have shrunk an inconceivable amount (I now get only about half a scoop of meat compared with an ample scoop and a half at other locations), significantly reducing my satisfaction as a customer. I e-mailed Chipotle directly with my concerns and received a copy and paste response almost two weeks after my complaint. Way to go!

<Content> Chipotle is the best. We all know it. But the thing is, this Chipotle could run a lot more efficiently. There is a lot of time waiting in line because the efficiency of getting more food on the line isn't as fast as it should be, especially for a fast-food chain 2 blocks away from campus. Why still four stars? Because it's delicious! I still go here all the time because the food is so fresh-- it must get replaced very frequently because of the amount of people that go here, so it's in its freshest state. All in all, good place, but could use some better efficiency.

The food is only nominally Mexican, meat is dry and not so flavorful, prices not all that reasonable, and the salsa tasteless. There's really no reason to go to either Qdoba or Chipotle with La Bamba and (even better) Los Amigos around.

Price wise, it is not cheap: a little below $8 dollars for a bowl of rice, your choice of mild to hot salsa, lettuce and beans with your choice of beef or chicken. The line is topically long if you show up around noon. They are fast in scooping your food once you get to the food counter though, I give them that.

There is always a long line, which is usually acceptable except when the line has to fold into the eating area. This chipotles burritos are usally 3/4 the size of the ones i get made for me at other chipotle places. Still this chipotle is able to fix my chipotle fix.
