<Content> Kofusion gets a massive amount of hype around Champaign. Probably because it's the only nice / higher-end sushi place. Kofusion does have other entree dishes besides sushi as well, but you're really going for the sushi.Which, I have to say, very good. The rolls are definitely ample. 2 Rolls was sufficient for 2 people for dinner. We had the red dragon roll and the dragon roll. Both had good amounts of fish and eel. The red dragon was especially great with the sriracha on top and the additional fish in the roll. Loved the flavor, didn't even use wasabi/soy for the red dragon half the time.Also, both rolls came on plates with a fair amount of extra eel sauce. So many places cut back on the eel sauce for no real reason, but it's fantastic and I loved wiping up the extra sauce.Overall, I'd be willing to go back.

<Content> Classy. Sushi. Need more be written? Sundays and Mondays are the days to be here for $1 sushi night! Beautiful ambience and food is fresh and well platted. They have lovely outdoor seating and can accommodate large parties.**host stand is not the most attentive and watch out for the heavy beads on the way to the loo**

<Content> When to dinner with a friend. Food was OK. The atmosphere: earnest trendiness. Learned afterwards that the waiter had charged my credit card twice for the meal. Not ideal. So, I called and called... and called. Over the course of three days, the manager was either not in or not able to help. So, if you go, make sure you're correctly charged. Don't expect the restaurant to be concerned otherwise.

<Content> This place was across the street from where I was staying when in town for a wedding. A group of us came to dinner before going bowling and the guy who helped us was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The ambiance in this place is really nice and I loved the fish tanks. The tea we ordered was delicious. I believe it was jasmine. The sushi was good and many at our table got the flaming phoenix and that was very cool to see brought to the table. Everyone really enjoyed their meal and our service was outstanding.

<Content> I've lived in Champaign my whole life, and I'd never eaten at K.O. Fusion before today. I'd heard a few people rave about the dollar sushi but most people say it's "meh". My friend invited me today to meet her for sushi at K.O. and I was looking forward to it. We got there at 11:15, and the server was really nice and very attentive. That's about all I can give this place. I ordered a chicken Bento box that was $15 - I cringed when I saw the price, but the server reassured me that it was "a LOT" of food. The box came, and it had chicken stir fry that was pretty plain. Then it had 4 little pieces of California roll that were OK. There was a lump of rice that was undercooked. There were a few pieces of lettuce with an overpowering ginger sauce on it. I'm a very hungry person and I'm the least picky eater I know, and I didn't finish the Bento box. It's not because I wasn't hungry - it's because I couldn't. But what's more, there was certainly NOT $15 worth of food on that plate -- it wasn't "a LOT" of food. I ordered veggie dumplings for my daughter, who seemed to liked them. I thought they were pretty good, but they were lukewarm (the server made a big deal about how hot they were - and they were definitely not). The bill came and it was almost $25. For $25, I better have eaten the very best lunch of my life!! And I would've been more satisfied with a $5 footlong, sadly. This place is ridiculous. They have some nerve to charge so much money for food that's not even up to par with cheap fast food. The other restaurants downtown, for the most part, are pretty good. They're still overrated, but better than K.O.! I won't be back.

<Content> What a trendy little spot this place is! I am a huge fan of fusion restaurants, so that alone made me excited about this place. However, I think after seeing some of the dishes our table got, I should have gone the japanese route and gotten some sushi or sashimi!I did get their scallops in a panany curry sauce that was pretty good. And it had avocado in it as well which I always appreciate. Not quite enough vegetables though for my liking, but the flavor overall was good and it taught me that I need to work on my chopstick skills a little more too! Speaking of chopsticks, our dinner group was all White and then one biracial Asian/White man and he was the only one to automatically be given chopsticks and the rest of us got asked about whether we wanted a western or eastern eating utensil! I could believe it, especially as a race researcher myself. Pretty funny stuff. What if that one biracial Asian guy didn't know how to use chopsticks?? That would have been all kinds of awkward. But the drinks were made strong here, the service was good, and the ambiance is pretty fun too. You definitely feel like you went out to dinner here!

<Content> Let me start by saying it was $1 sushi day. And let me also say that the sushi was good. Very good even. The nigiri we ordered was great as well. But the service? The service was horrible. 20 min wait for water, 40 min wait for meal, 30 min more for the second round of sushi, and a whopping 90 min waiting for them to sort out our checks. I talked to the manager. "10 more min and you'll be out of here, I promise." They still had our checks missed up. A 20% discount and free desserts later, I still don't know if I'm going to be back. Too bad. I really liked the meal.

<Content> Living in the midwest, you have to understand that sushi options are limited. Kofusion more than satisfies this. They have an expansive sushi menu that caters to every sushi lover, as well as a lunch/dinner menu with some tasty meat and vegetarian options.The food is always fresh - the coconut shrimp with mango is out of this world, as is the volcano roll.  I've had the shiro and maguro nigiri numerous times - it's always consistently good.The dining area is nice - trendy, semi-upscale with private rooms for larger parties.

<Content> It's pretty good sushi done with a Midwest emphasis, served by mostly nice folks, under some weird mood lighting that thinks it might be hip but mostly makes me think about hitting some acid.I'm surprised people gripe about the price, since it costs more to eat at several of the burger joints close by. Seafood in the Midwest is absurd to purchase, so I expect it to be a little pricier, but it's fairly comparable. Today, we ordered an app, two bar drinks, three rolls and two desserts and it was $63. Not bad, IMO. I always wish the menu was more descriptive, especially about what sauces come on which rolls. I about burnt my lip off today. The service is hit or miss. Some of the staff behaves a little lofty, but maybe that's what they think people expect. Or maybe some people are just assholes. Anyway...if you're on the fence, go for dollar sushi and give it a try. You can order online, which is sweet. If you call it in, make sure they read it back. So...four stars for a lack of consistency.

<Content> We called in for appetizer trays of assorted sushi and rolls. The fish was prepared perfect and was some of the freshest I've ever had. No fish smell. The nice lady I worked with was very professional and accommodating even staying open 30 min later for us to take away our order on a Sunday.The price of sushi vary greatly in parts of the USA but I would say this was on the high side. I would recommend this place to someone with out hesitation as long as they realize this is not a budget meal.

<Content> Hate to say it......this just wasn't a good sushi experience. I've had sushi in different places all over the US, and this was genuinely one of the most unduly pricey yet unremarkable meals. Kofusion is mostly about being downtown and seeing/being seen-- it's the only "little bit of LA" that we have, and is a good place to go for sushi & drinks before clubbing. Then the problem presents its self- where to go clubbing? lOlI visited Kofusion with two guests, with the intention of "introducing them to sushi"- and was really disappointed, even a little embarrassed. I feel like there are chains on the west coast like Kabuki which offer far more exciting food, dramatically bigger portions, and with less contrived pretentiousness.

<Content> Kofusion is an interesting name for a restaurant, and they have, I was told, the best sushi in the Champaign/Urbana area.But when you've had sushi in diverse places, you really only know what's bad. Thankfully, this wasn't. I had the Trio roll and it was very good. My date had the fried soft shell crab roll and the portion was huge. Typically I don't eat crab, but I helped her finish what was left and it wasn't too bad, and she said it was excellent.We shared Edamame too...I mean, who could mess up Edamame? Good stuff.We topped it off with a nice Italian (I think) Pinot for her, and I had a Bartenura Moscato. Again, goodness!Kofusion is the best in the area they say. I can see why they say.

<Content> When friends ask me to describe this restaurant, I jokingly say, "It's the kind of place where people eat their sushi with a fork and knife."To Kofusion's credit, it's the only venue in this rural Midwest town that attempts the urban dance-club sushi experience. Against that backdrop, it really is filling a unique niche. East Coast + West Coast elitist diners will likely be unimpressed (if you're ensnared here for years due to work or school, the nostalgia/desperation for big city experiences might change your mind).Arguably, if you're eating at an Asian fusion restaurant, you should have no expectations of "authenticity" in regards to the food. The drink selection features fruity cocktails with sexy, "exotic" names and $9+ price tags. Many items on the menu are outright American cuisine lacking even a hint of "fusing" with Asian elements. In that respect, this place is ideal for groups made up of both adventurous diners and those who fear "fish breath."The biggest draw for Kofusion are the Sunday and Monday $1 sushi specials. Folks with raw food aversions need not worry. All of the $1 sushi options are variations of deep-fried meats, cream cheese filling, and mayonnaise/sugary sauces. There's such a demand on these nights that the preparation definitely cuts corners--but if you're filling up on these bite-sized heart-attacks, you're likely channeling your inner fat kid and won't mind the rushed presentation.For people who love Japanese cuisine for its delicate, clean flavors, the sushi bar also serves more "traditional" fare, though I've sometimes received pieces of sashimi sliced rather clumsily.My advice: the $1 price tag for the Sunday/Monday specials requires such little investment that it's worth a shot for new diners. It might even be the best opportunity for initiating people who are normally turned off by the idea of sushi.

<Content> I'm a SOCAL gal and therefore a bit of a sushi snob, but Kofusion was a nice surprise here in the land of flat.They certainly don't present their sushi in a way that I'm used to, nor are their offerings in any way comparable to a 'real' sushi restaurant, but that said - I like this place. The servers are great and the $1 sushi Sunday crowd was huge and happy. Happy? I'd say so! You just can't beat being well fed on fish and having an appetizer and a drink for $20.I looked at their regular sushi menu and was surprised: It is pricy in comparison to SOCAL sushi but I suppose location and limited competition have an impact, so I'll stick to Sundays. Their Big Roll was a nice surprise and there was enough spicy tuna to keep me happy. Next time I'll pass on their very average deserts and instead opt for MORE sushi!

<Content> I'm gonna be as simple as possible for the overall review: It's subpar restaurant at an above average price, unless you're having the dollar sushi. Then it's almost acceptable for the quality of the sushi you get.Everything else is pretty mediocre, yet they're charging for a higher end restaurant price. You're paying for atmosphere and that's about it. Yet, this is the best sushi place located in the CU area in terms of quality. So if you're desperate for sushi and have loads of money, give this place a try.

<Content> Kofusion is not authentic sushi, but it's still delicious. Many of the rolls are deep fried or have cooked meat in them. I recommend the Big Roll which is available at dollar sushi all day Sundays and Monday afternoons. Sometimes the service is a little sketchy, one time I was served a drink in a dirty glass and the bartender didn't really seem that surprised or apologetic.

<Content> "Good Area Sushi, Great Atmosphere, $1 Sushi Sunday"Ko Fusion offers decent sushi for Champaign-Urbana area. Set conveniently downtown Champaign, the restaurant's atmosphere is very modern and chic - almost like a restaurant out of Chicago - and offers fusion entrees outside of their sushi menu. Ko Fusion offers a large bar area and outdoor seating.$1 Sushi Sunday is their best deal, which allows diners to sample $1 pieces of sushi from their menu.

<Content> Kofusion is definitely a good spot for a "nicer" dinner in Champaign. I'd been here a long time ago (like a year and a half ago) right after the place opened, and it was kind of dead and empty. But I went again a couple of nights ago, and the place was fairly crowded and happening. I was by myself so I sat at the bar, where the bartender took very good care of me.First a few words about the place: it's fairly large, with two different seating areas separated by the bar area, and they obviously spent the bucks on the decor. It's fairly modern, with a black and dark blue color scheme, a (fairly) beautiful bar, etc... You somehow can't help thinking that maybe they tried a little too hard to look sophisticated, but nonetheless it makes for a fairly good ambiance.The food is a mix of Asian (mostly Japanese) and new American. I'm usually weary of fusion... but it wasn't bad at all. The first time I was here, I ordered the chirashi, which wasn't the best I've had in my life but was surprisingly decent considering the location (as far from any ocean as you can be in the country...). This time, I started with a seaweed salad (tasty), followed by the whole trout, which came with sauteed mushrooms and spinach... The trout was pretty good, and the veggies delicious. I finished with the black sesame ice-cream: for $4, I expected a tiny little scoop, but I was served a heaping bowl of ice-cream with a strawberry and a wafer... just great.Not to forget their drinks: they have a pretty large selection of wine and sake, as well as a full bar. I had one of their specialty cocktails (the ko-tini: sake, absolut, and peach schnapps in a martini glass... pretty good), and another mixed drink. I was especially shocked to see how inexpensive they were, being used to NY prices.Based on the food only, I would have given this place 3-1/2 to 4 stars, but the service was top notch. The bartender was extremely friendly and efficient, and treated me very well... I'll probably be back.

<Content> Arrogant, unnattentive waiters, poor service, unfortunately the best sushi in town.Over the past month I've eaten $40+ meal THREE separate times during dollar sushi and received poor/horrible service. Each time, the waiter either forgot about us or didn't realize we were there, OR forgot to give us basic things like chopsticks, ginger, etc, and we waited another 5-10 minutes before my fiance went to the front to ask for some.After the third afternoon this happened, I brought it to the attention of a waiter who discussed it was dollar sushi so i can expect bad service.I then brought it up to the hostess when paying for my meal, telling him we come during the lunch hour to avoid poor service like what we experienced. He stated that I shouldn't come on dollar sushi night if I expect good service. Why would I come on another night to take a chance on poor service and PAY MORE?!?!

<Content> I go to used to go to Ko 2 to 3 times a month for the dollar sushi nights (Sunday AND Monday). Dollar sushi nights used to feature around 10 rolls at discounted prices, each week a few of the rolls on the dollar menu would differ from the ones offered the week before. The service was HORRIBLE, but the sushi made up for it and at $1 a piece you are paying around 70% of normal price (and since they are so overpriced at Ko to begin with this meant you were paying what you would pay anywhere else).Lately I've stopped going to Ko for several reasons. The dollar sushi menu no longer changes. It is nearly CONSTANT from week to week. Sure it's a super discount so you can't complain too much. However, sometimes some of the sushi you order comes to the table reeking of fish. The pieces are $1 because clearly the fish is old. And finally the service is utterly horrible on Sunday/Monday nights. Sure they are busy, but the wait staff simply suck.To sum it up you can get sushi that is just as good and just as cheap at several other places in Champaign/Urbana. Branch out a bit, trendy neon lights that change color don't mean the food is good.

<Content> Well crap, I might be about to earn a bitch-badge. The interior decor to me is not hip, trendy, or modern. Unless you think that one friend with his blacklight room, lava lamps and Spencers Gifts-like light gadgets is awesome. In which case, carry on my friend. To each his own and all.Got take-out. Called ahead for lunch sushi sampler and tempura. Perhaps the first indication should've been my order takers complete stupification upon hearing they offered a sushi sampler. They told me food would be ready in 20 min.Which was almost exactly how long I waited after arriving 20 min later. Not cool on the service tip, Ko. Sushi was fairly good, no complaint there. The "tempura"? So not. Not tempura at all. More like the deep fried veggies sold at a county fair.No win for you, Ko, and no second visit. Ever.

<Content> I've been to Kofusion several times. The interior is very modern and sleek. The entrees are pricey and portions are on the smaller side. The servers are friendly and attentive. The $1 sushi deals on Sundays and Mondays are worth it. My favorite is definitely the big roll; I believe it has egg, crabmeat, avocado and some other stuff, then tempura fried with some sort of sauce on top. The best deal...and I'm kinda mad that I found out right before I graduated...is the lunch buffet! It's sucha great deal. Only weekdays though. The buffet is only around $10 and includes various entrees, such as curry chicken, fried fish croquettes, kimchi, soup, fried rice, noodles and three different types of sushi. The big roll is usually one of the three. Definitely keeps you full without breaking your wallet. :)

<Content> Went for dinner. Paid 60 dollars for some tea and "mains" that left two of us very hungry and considering a run for red lobster. Returned for dollar sushi upon all the good yelp reviews but found that it really wasn't worth it either. Lots of filler rice and sauces. Hardly any substance to any of the "rolls" by "rolls" they mean pieces, which really isn't a deal at all. Plus, really poorly done rice at that. Ick.Very nice service but considering the food, I say go to Sushi Kame down the road instead.

<Content> Well, where to start?The owner of this place is rude to guests and employees. She wanders around forever, blankly looking at the ceiling (or so it seems). I hate to be so harsh, but I applied for a job there. The woman asked me 2-4 questions and decided to hire me. Then, the owner came in the next morning and decided it wasn't going to work out. They wasted four hours of my time and showed me how not local and not fresh the food is. Really, they aren't unlike many other restaurants now a days. With so many people to feed and pressure to make money, there isn't much choice. I was excited to go to a "hip" place and work with sushi, something I'd never done before. But the other employees were hipster-ish and snobby. I go back there because the sushi is enjoyable and my boyfriend likes it. Last time we went (6-6-10) it took us almost 30 minutes just to get our check, because the owner didn't schedule enough people. I'm a waitress; I understand this issue. Naturally, we still tipped our waitress. However, when people come into town, there are many many restaurants I would recommend before KoFusion.

<Content> Kofusion tries a bit too hard to be hip and edgy. As I am from Los Angeles, where pretentious restaurants are about as ubiquitous as corn is here, it takes more than mood lighting, pseudo-orientalist hipness, and cheap sushi specials to impress.That said, Kofusion's not *that* bad. It's decent, for what you get. The sushi is adequate, the drinks are on point, and the servers are friendly. Not a bad way to spend a Friday night with friends. Just don't think you're a) being "authentic" or (b) truly hip and classy.Just enjoy for what it is, a decent midrange sushi place in the midst of Chambana.

For under $20, you can have a VERY filling sushi meal at Kofusion. This isn't the best place in town for 'authentic' sushi, but they certainly do have some fun creations. If you've never been here, Monday is an excellent time to try the place out without breaking the bank. Just consider getting threre early... it tends to get busy as the night goes on! It's a fun place with an interesting atmosphere and cheap sushi. You can't go wrong. Recommended.)

<Content> I went to Kofusion on Monday, April 23rd, just before 6 and met my friend and her two sons for dollar sushi night. If my friend and her boys weren't already there, I would have turned around and left. I got a really bad first impression. It was busy (but nobody else was at the hostess station) and the hostess asked me if she could help me. I said that I was looking for my friend and her two young sons. She got really snotty, rolled her eyes and said, "Well, you're just going to have to look for them yourself." Maybe she was just having a bad day. Who knows. I walked around and still didn't see them when another hostess came up and asked if SHE could help me. I told her who I was looking for and she goes, "Oh! I know right where they are, come with me." She was cheerful and really helpful. It made up for the other super, rude hostess. We had the best waiter I have ever had in this town. No kidding. I saved my receipt so I could remember his name. It was Luke H. He was super attentive, extremely polite, friendly, and really sweet to my friend's kids. Our drinks never went empty and he checked in on us plenty without being annoying or hovering. Being dollar sushi night, I expected a longer wait for our food but our rolls were out quickly. They were all really good, too. The edamame and dumplings were great, also. Super big thanks to Luke H. and the NICE hostess. Hope the other one's attitude improves.

<Content> Sadly, I discovered Kofusion only a couple months before I graduated but once I discovered the place, I quickly became a regular! Firstly, people should recognize the restaurant for what it is: Korean fushion food. Thus, there's a wide variety of sushi, my personal favorite: hwe dup bap (like sashimi salad) and a smaller selection of hot (but still great--scallops anyone?) entrees that I usually have no interest in because I love sushi that much. If you need a quick sushi fix, dollar sushi Sundays (1 roll = $1) will definitely satisfy your cravings. There are 10 rolls that are offered at that price and they are definitely more of an American style sushi roll (read: little to no raw fish). At first I was really disappointed by this, but I honestly felt like the other rolls were good enough (Big Roll! Coconut Roll!) that I didn't mind at all and eat about $15-$20 worth of sushi anyway. Yes, I am a sushi whore. If you really want good sushi (with more raw fish or more interesting combinations), Kofusion is still the place to go. Their sushi menu is surprisingly extensive with your typical simple salmon rolls to rainbow-type rolls and more. It's about $1-$2 dollars more expensive than the other places in town but I've never felt like my rolls weren't worth the cost. Finally, Kristina is my favorite waitress. Maybe she remembered me for my order (hwe dup bap--seriously, try it if you love raw fish, it is divine) or maybe because I loved her so much I tipped well, but after just a few weeks of going weekly, a lot of the waiters remembered me and greeted me warmly. As a sushi lover, it doesn't really get any better than this. I'm not going to lie, Kofusion hits your wallet pretty hard but in the world of sushi, I don't find them especially more expensive than other sushi places that offer the same variety and quality of rolls. One recommendation I have is to try and get a roll (i.e. Big Roll--that's the one I had) wrapped in soy/rice paper. For those that don't like sushi because of the seaweed, this is a great alternative. For those that still love sushi, try it anyway--it's a great substitution that's worth it to get on its own once in awhile. I will forever miss Kofusion now that I'm not in the area so please, go get the hwe dup bap, Big Roll, Coconut Roll, or even the thai curry for me please!

<Content> Went here while visiting family in Central IL. I had been here years ago and loved it. While it was still awesome this time around, I feel like they have downsized their sushi menu and there weren't as many options. BUT, the two rolls I did order (and kim chi and the GF mousse cake) were all wonderfully delicious, came out quickly, and I will definitely return next time I'm in the area!

<Content> KoFusion is easily the best sushi in Champaign-Urbana. They have a wide selection of Japanese food. Also, on Sunday and Monday, they offer 10 different rolls for $1 each. It's absolutely glorious.The atmosphere is also one of the best in Champaign-Urbana. With sushi this good, I would be satisfied with a hole-in-the-wall location. However, KoFusion is classy! There are tanks of fish, complicated ambient lighting, waterfalls, and many other clever design elements. HIGHLY recommend.

<Content> It sort of pains me to not give Kofusion a higher rating because their sushi is really, really good. It's probably some of the best in town, though some of their true standouts also happen to be the most expensive. If I were grading it on it's sushi only I would give it four stars easily. The place has a nice atmosphere and is certainly more thought out than your typical CU restaurant. Is it trying too hard? Maybe, but let's be honest any attempt at trying could be perceived as "trying to hard" here because most places don't make any effort at all.So... shame about the food. I've only tried to eat from their non-sushi menu twice and have been disappointed each time. They're main dishes are over-priced and lack flavor. I will say their seafood had a nice, fresh taste but they don't really do anything with it. I'd recommend getting some friends, ordering a couple baskets of edamame, some drinks and many different kinds of sushi. My favorite is definitely the Lava Roll.

<Content> Duck was excellent! Update: we returned more recently and tried the sushi, which was terrible -- it tasted like it had been frozen. The menu is also completely random -- the restaurant doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: Korean, Japanese, American. The food isn't *fusion*, its just three different types of cuisine on the same menu -- no one dish is a fusion of anything.

<Content> I often get dragged here every few weeks with coworkers since it is close to my work. I have not been impressed one time. I got to admit the inside is uniquely decorated, but I dislike almost everything else about this restaurant. To start, the waiters are really rude and arrogant. They all seem to have this pompous flair to them and I don't know why. It most certainly does not make a good server. They seem to act disgusted almost every time you ask them for something, and are neglectful of your table way more often that not. It's not surprising for them to forget your table completely... The owner is also very arrogant, and acts sickeningly (and fake-ly) nice as she wanders aimlessly around the restaurant. The food is alright, but most is very underwhelming to me. The food is not very authentic, (aside from the sushi) and is more of an Americanized Asian restaurant (much like P.F. Changs), and I tend to hate those types of restaurants. When I want Asian food, I want REAL Asian food. Not crappy American creations labeled as Chinese food. It's pretty expensive too. Way overpriced in my opinion. There is a $10 lunch buffet, but there are often only 4 entrees to choose from, and not much else in the ways of other food. Fried and white rice? Usually two plates of generic (and really cheap) sushi? Totally not worth $10 at all. Order from the menu for lunch and you are looking at paying over $10. Dinner is even worse. While I only went once for dinner, and usually end up here for the lunch buffet, the time I did go for dinner was terrible. The menu is almost set up like a gourmet restaurant, as there's not a big selection at all, and most meals cost around $20. O_O The worst part is, the entrees come out on huge plates with the tiniest bit of food in the middle. They call it New Age Dining but I call it "I just got seriously ripped off"I ordered the salmon dish. It was $21 I think. Ridiculous, I know. Well, it came out raw in the middle. I sent it back, 10 minutes later it comes back, and still raw. I had to send it back twice and even after the third time it came back it did not taste right to me. And like I said, it was the tiniest portion ever. It was maybe a 6oz salmon filet on a plate garnished with sauce next to like a 1/4 cup of rice.... it really is pitiful. My friend's entrees were similarly scarce looking. I really don't know how this place gets so packed when it is so expensive and the food is not that good. It's touted as a huge date spot as well, but I'm surprised most stomach up the huge entry cost. I hear the sushi is great but I never had anything other than the stuff they put out on the lunch buffet and it was terrible. It seems expensive too like everything else. Some praise the $1 sushi night, but that's per piece and personally to me that seems like a high price as well.... I would stay away if I were you, I often even find myself backing out of lunch with my coworkers simply because I can not stand this restaurant any more.

<Content> Went for dinner. Paid 60 dollars for some tea and "mains" that left two of us very hungry and considering a run for red lobster. Returned for dollar sushi upon all the good yelp reviews but found that it really wasn't worth it either. Lots of filler rice and sauces. Hardly any substance to any of the "rolls" by "rolls" they mean pieces, which really isn't a deal at all. Plus, really poorly done rice at that. Ick.Very nice service but considering the food, I say go to Sushi Kame down the road instead.

<Content> Kofusion tries a bit too hard to be hip and edgy. As I am from Los Angeles, where pretentious restaurants are about as ubiquitous as corn is here, it takes more than mood lighting, pseudo-orientalist hipness, and cheap sushi specials to impress.That said, Kofusion's not *that* bad. It's decent, for what you get. The sushi is adequate, the drinks are on point, and the servers are friendly. Not a bad way to spend a Friday night with friends. Just don't think you're a) being "authentic" or (b) truly hip and classy.Just enjoy for what it is, a decent midrange sushi place in the midst of Chambana.

For under $20, you can have a VERY filling sushi meal at Kofusion. This isn't the best place in town for 'authentic' sushi, but they certainly do have some fun creations. If you've never been here, Monday is an excellent time to try the place out without breaking the bank. Just consider getting threre early... it tends to get busy as the night goes on! It's a fun place with an interesting atmosphere and cheap sushi. You can't go wrong. Recommended.)

<Content> I went to Kofusion on Monday, April 23rd, just before 6 and met my friend and her two sons for dollar sushi night. If my friend and her boys weren't already there, I would have turned around and left. I got a really bad first impression. It was busy (but nobody else was at the hostess station) and the hostess asked me if she could help me. I said that I was looking for my friend and her two young sons. She got really snotty, rolled her eyes and said, "Well, you're just going to have to look for them yourself." Maybe she was just having a bad day. Who knows. I walked around and still didn't see them when another hostess came up and asked if SHE could help me. I told her who I was looking for and she goes, "Oh! I know right where they are, come with me." She was cheerful and really helpful. It made up for the other super, rude hostess. We had the best waiter I have ever had in this town. No kidding. I saved my receipt so I could remember his name. It was Luke H. He was super attentive, extremely polite, friendly, and really sweet to my friend's kids. Our drinks never went empty and he checked in on us plenty without being annoying or hovering. Being dollar sushi night, I expected a longer wait for our food but our rolls were out quickly. They were all really good, too. The edamame and dumplings were great, also. Super big thanks to Luke H. and the NICE hostess. Hope the other one's attitude improves.

<Content> This place is grossly overpriced and the only day that is worth going is probably sushi night on Mondays. It says that it's $1 sushi but what they didn't tell you is that it's $1 a piece and only limited to 10 selections; AND you have to order the entire 10-piece sampler. Very tricky indeed. On other days, a 8-10-piece sushi roll can be about $8-$15. The ambience is great and this place is definitely wonderful for parties and gatherings. Worth a try.

<Content> Never, ever again.This place is awful. Overpriced, bad food, and to top it off? TERRIBLE service. My friend ordered some type of roll, and she asked they do something different to it. Something minor. So, take a wild guess how many times it came out? Not once, not twice, not even three times...on the FOURTH try it was correct. And every time, the waitress getting increasingly ruder. Finally, before the last time, I asked to have the owner come out, which she did and was somewhat apologetic, but still acted like it was no big deal!I ordered a scallop curry dish. It was strange to say the least, and they cut the scallops in half crosswise! Bizarre, other than they were trying to make it look like my overpriced tiny "sea" scallops were worth it. They were the smallest sea scallops I've ever seen. I am from New England, but I am not expecting the same seafood in Illinois, but COME ON! You aren't fooling anyone. I am amazed anyone really thinks this is a 5 star place. It was the worst restaurant experience second only to the time I ate at Miko's...that was worse.

Apple smoked bacon and unagi roll? Tasty indeed. Their other novelty rolls are extremely tasty as well. However, their traditional sushi isn't that great.Every other time we're in town we find ourselves getting the salmon triangles, which are truly unique in an onigiri sort of way. It reminds me of that "fan tuan" at Taiwan 7-Elevens, cept with salmon! This place is on the expensive side, but this is my favorite "rolls" place in Champaign. Note that I say rolls, and not sushi in general.

I believe the quality of fish is extremely poor, over priced, and simply, not tasty. I have been there multiple times only to ask myself why? The only reason why I guess I decided to give it two stars instead of one is the service and drinks. Only saving grace.

We had finished, started getting ready to leave. William became upset because he couldn't find something he had brought with him.  We got to the car, i went back in to ask if they found something (a toy) at our location to call me and i would return to pick it up. As i returned to the car, our waiter (Daniel) followed me out and had found the stylus that had been dropped by William.The food was good, the service with that little extra effort made our dinner excellent.

Once a girl that I had to point out the wine on the list, a Sauvignon Blanc, and she brought me a red??? Another really bad server just would not leave us alone because it was slow, though I forgave it because he was REALLY hot, like most of their staff. That should not matter, but I would rather look at a hot guy, then not.

<Content> I like kofusion, although I mostly like it for the $1 sushi. ONE DOLLAR SUSHI ON MONDAY NIGHTS! Don't miss that shit. The one dollar sushi is as american as it comes (ie fried, filled with cream cheese, and most often not raw) but it is one dollar. ONE DOLLAR! I've never eaten off the non-sushi menu, but I have had the sake mojito about a million times. I did not like it as much as a rum mojito at first; not sweet enough, a little sour for a mojito, but it is quite distinctive and grows on me every time I have it. The ambience, I believe, is as good as it gets in champaign. Nice tranquil water fountains and fish tanks and high def tvs with fishtanks and water fountains playing on them.Service varies. On one dollar sushi night it (understandably) takes a while for the food to come out, and the politeness of the wait staff during that lengthy interval is not always as high as it might be.

I've only eaten it on dollar sushi nights, which, now that I think about it, is a spectacular bargain.For a Champaign restaurant, Kofusion has a very modern look; frosted glass, colored lights, and random decorations add to the very un-Champaign look and feel, which is refreshing at times.I've also been told that they hold salsa nights here, though I haven't experienced it. Overall, great place on those dollar sushi nights. Can't say much for the rest.

<Content> Wow, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! Where to start? They have some of the best sushi in town! I usually get spicy tuna rolls. My husband is a bit more adventurous so I like to nosh on whatever he has ordered, too. Although I have never intentionally eaten uni, I can share that my husband loves to get a piece or two whenever we come.This place also has some great entree and dessert options. They have a great wagyu beef entree with potatoes and vegetables that is absolute perfection. Additionally, they have a trio of ice creams that are so, so delicious.Drinks are always good. Service is usually pretty good (they lose a point because this is not always the case). If you do not like overstimulation, avoid Kofusion unless it is warmer out. The outdoor seating is lovely but can lead to spending a lot of money on mojitos. It's worth it.

<Content> Too much for too little. I like the decor, the location, and I half-like the food. I hate the prices. I also hate it when people think that this is the best Sushi place in CU without trying the others.Sushi is expensive. I also understand that not just any restaurant gets access to high quality fish, especially in bumble fuck Chambana. None of these justify the price premium KoFusion demands over the (superior IMHO) Yelowfin, not to mention the also rans Kamakura and Miko. If decor doesn't matter, and cost is an object (when is it not?) Sushi Kame is the best bet.As for their rolls, I do think they can be good. When they are good, they are just as good as the above restaurants. When they are not, they suffer the same perennial complaints for not being well rolled or being skimpy. I have not heard any complaints that their fish was bad, and I grant that this in itself is an accomplishment. The chirashi is reputedly quite good, though I have not had it.Their "deal night" is not really a deal. They get you in with the promise of a cheap meal, but the pieces that are $1 each are really tiny. If you are a person who normally orders 2 rolls, you will not be happy with your 10 small (but good) pieces. You will end up ordering an additional roll and maybe more. If that additional roll isn't one of the ones that are in the 10 pieces for $10 deal, prepare to wait for an eternity and a half.

<Content> My only complaint with Kofusion is that it is a little too loud.The food is all well executed and neatly plated. I've eaten sushi from Niigata to New York, and while the nigiri clearly isn't as fresh as it could be (being that Kofusion is a thousand miles away from any ocean), I think the maki here is pretty darn good.

<Content> Tried it out on dollar sushi sunday. Food (3/5)Overall the food was meh. Very heavy on sauce and some of the pieces were downright tiny. Granted they were $1 a piece. Pretty bad unagi - which I wouldn't think is that hard to mess up. Some of the rolls were tasty, but I could barely taste anything besides rice and sauce. Service (-10/5)Our waiter was easily the worst I've ever had. He was probably hungover - he mumbled the entire time and repeatedly spilled water. The rest of the staff seemed aloof and apathetic as well. Ambiance (2/5)This is one ugly restaurant. It seemed clean enough, but the tacky fish tanks and lights did not foster any trust that I would be getting quality food.Overall (2/5)Maybe they had an off day. Maybe they slack on sundays. $1 sushi is the only redeeming quality.

<Content> First, the positives: The sushi is actually very good! Also, if you want to splurge on desert, the ginger ice cream is good, too. I ate here with my family and, as I did, they all enjoyed the food.Unfortunately, that's all I have for the positives. The food, as good as it is, is overpriced. The atmosphere (which I admittedly can't speak in detail about since we were sitting outside) seemed...I don't know...off. However, by far the worst was the terrible service we received. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but our server really seemed to cop an attitude toward us and took FOREVER tending to our needs. Twice, someone from my party actually had to get up and retrieve him from whatever he was doing so he could actually, you know, do his job. This really should not happen, especially at a place that bills itself as such an upscale, better-than-the-average-restaurant kind of place.This really soured what should have been a great experience. I may give this place another chance some time. However, it'll be a while before I do. I guess if you really have a hankering for sushi, you could do worse. Just be aware of all the crap that comes with it.

<Content> My friend and I came to Kofusion on a Tuesday, so it was not nearly as crowded as on dollar sushi nights (Sundays AND Mondays). The first thing you notice is the dcor: indoor seating is cozy, with an outdoor patio section, ambient lighting and nice candles on the tables (a small detail, but something I love :)  My friend had sushi rolls while I had select pieces of nigiri (salmon, smoked salmon, tuna, shrimp, and tuna caviar). Now this review may be biased due to the weeks of sushi-deprivation I had experienced prior to coming in...but the food was delicious! The pieces were well-cut, artfully arranged, and you could tell the fish was good quality. The best part of the night (aside from the great company) was the service. The waiter was very friendly, entertaining, and came by many times to checkup on us. The service really took the whole dining experience up a notch.  P.S. The mojitos were great too! Will definitely be coming back for more sushi and drinks nights.

<Content> Food is generally good but the service has been hit or miss. The servers tend to get noticeably overwhelmed on busy night (e.g. dollar sushi) and there can be long delays. The quality of the food is high and Ko-Fusion does a good job of simulating your typical big city Asian-Fusion, neon lights, lounge music type place. The dollar sushi is a great deal and the rotating options are tasty though sort of cheapish in that they feature a lot of imitation crab based rolls. However for a buck a piece, it's a fair enough trade-off. On my last visit, my gf and I each ordered tea and the server forget which pot was which. To check she practically shoved her nose in one pot to take a whiff and figure it out. Ko-Fusion is good but not great.

<Content> While the restaurant was gorgeous and the staff was well trained, I must say for the price you are paying I expect to get super fresh tasting fish. I ordered the chirashi (my go to dish at sushi places when I am not sharing) And while the portion was decent, the tuna and octopus both tasted slightly off, like it was old. The other fish on the plate, while fresh, just didn't have a lot of flavor. In short you pay a lot for pretty average fish, almost 1.5-2x what I would pay for the quality I recieved(depending on the dish) there are many better places in the area, that have tastier fish and are a bit more reasonably priced.

<Content> Probably about as cool as the Champaign dining scene gets...at least from my limited exposure to it. In a town, though, lacking in nicer Asian fare, it's disappointing that Kofusion's menu strays into French, American and Italian food, but I guess that's why "fusion" is in the name of the restaurant. My dinner selections focused on Japanese items, which were of high quality - sashimi pieces were HUGE and sushi rolls, while small, were mostly tasty. I was fairly impressed at how fresh the fish was, but taken aback by how costly the sushi was.Patrons seemed to mostly be from the university - a bunch of students and some professorial types. Kofusion certainly is the place to see and be seen in downtown Champaign and it's going to be a place I'll surely check out every time I visit the in-laws.

Get there early for the buffet as it got crowded at noon. I got there quite early and was a disappointed in the temperature of the food; it already seemed to be getting cold.

<Content> I loved the vibe of this place and our server was excellent, but the prices are outrageous. It's ludicrous for a place to charge $8 for a California roll and $10 for a spicy tuna. The food was above average sushi, but come on! I get that it may be more expensive to get fresh fish to Campaign than Chicago, but I didn't expect to be giving my arm and my leg to pay for a specialty roll. I can see why the place is a huge draw when they have specials, but I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot poll if you are paying full price.

<Content> I've eaten here a lot because I enjoy the sushi, but most of the time i've received food I just get it to go. The service is truly not the best and it's disappointing. One time I waited 25 minutes before even getting greated and another 2-3 minutes after the other 3 in my party arrived. The last time in town I went and sat at the bar yet time passed and nobody was there. I flagged down the host to see if they even had a bartender on staff and they grabbed one girl who got me started, some other guy showed up and said he entered my food, then some other guy finished as I was looking around for "bartender: #2" to get my check. Literally (sort of literally), the only good thing from here is the food.

<Content> Despite looking like the children's exhibits at the Shedd Aquarium, KoFusion has some respectable food. The main reason is that they seem really good at sourcing the best ingredients. Everything on the menu seems to have a pedigree: Immerwald Farms Pork, wild line-caught fish, and Wagyu beef are typical menu items.Dinner can get quite pricey, but the service is good and the food is delicious. I can't say it's as creative as other establishments in town, but it's done well. I also love that they have meats like wild boar on the menu. The exception is Sunday and Monday, which is $1 sushi night. The sushi isn't the greatest, but it's decent enough and I'll merrily eat it despite the fact that you aren't supposed to eat seafood on those days because they are probably leftovers. Oh well. Lunch is far more affordable, especially on Mondays when they have $1 Sushi. I think the Bento Box, which has quite a lot of food, is a good deal. Recently it's had salmon cake, California rolls, Wagyu beef/organic chicken, rice, vegetables, and a salad, but the contents vary. I think I could make two meals out of it and they do allow takeout, but usually I devour it pretty quickly because it's so good.Many people think the interior here is suave, but if you look at it long enough it just looks tacky.

<Content> Honestly, I rarely frequented this place when it wasn't a Sunday or Monday Night ($1 sushi night), maybe once or twice when I had a craving.But I'm smart enough to go on the $1 nights so I don't feel bad (was then a college student). On regular nights - it can be seen as pricey. On $1 night, it is awesome. I love the big roll. If you are a first time Sushi eater, try that one first, it is like a flavor party in your mouth. Anything with crab is easy peasy for a first timer. It was my first one.I slowly ventured into others and now I can eat almost anything and usually love them all. Most of their $1 sushi is delicious. If you are vegetarian, don't run away, their veggie futo roll/vegetarian maki is gross, but get the one you can custom make and have them tempura fry it, they might give u some crap about not being able to tempura fry it but they can and it will be yummy, I guarantee it!They also have tiramisu, which is great because I love it. And a bunch of other fusion dishes for the non-sushi eaters. I don't know why people complain about the decor, despite the glass bricks, it has a pretty cool contemporary/marina style...which kind of makes sense, duh.

<Content> I was in Urbana, IL for a few days on business. I dined at two restaurants and this was one of them.The place was rather empty, but that's because it was Halloween evening.With that being said, the interior design is pretty cool but feels a bit cold. I had a couple of things on the menu. I had the halibut as my main dish and the california roll just for fun. I was very stuffed by the end of the evening. I liked both dishes.I think Ko Fusion needs to focus on one cuisine. It's trying to be everything to everyone. But what I had was tasty. The outside signage says 'Steak Pizza Sushi Seafood.' What the hell kinda combination is that? I'd go back if I was in town. :)

<Content> I would give this place 2.5 stars.There was nothing really terrible about kofusion but there wasn't anything that great about it either!Atmosphere- fine. A little sparkly for my taste but whatever. It was busy, otherwise sitting outside on the patio would have been much nicer.Service- I know it was busy but the service was a mess. The food came out really fast but none of us had chopsticks, or soy sauce, or ginger, or wasabi, and they were about to just leave us! Not to mention trying to get a drink!Food- pretty bland and mushy with a couple good standouts on my sampler plate. I swear, one of the bad ones must have been the bologna of the sea because it looked/tasted like a hunk of spam stuffed into a roll form topped with some sauce. I spit that one out. There were a couple good pieces that after I try every other sushi restaurant in C-U I might come back for.

<Content> I was in a business in Champaign and asked the employee there for a recommendation for Japanese food/sushi. He said Kofusion, so I looked it up Yelp.In spite of the assorted poor reviews, I went to Kofusion for dinner anyway, since it was Monday and I read (here) that it's Dollar Sushi on Monday. It took a few minutes even to get to the hostess, who said there was a long wait (the place was packed), but I could sit at the bar immediately. She responded in the affirmative when I asked if I could order from the same menu.So sit at the bar I did. For the uninitiated, the 'dollar sushi' is per PIECE, not per ROLL. So, calculate accordingly. However, these are not your regular old California rolls, or good ole spicy tuna, salmon skin roll, etc. These are fancier and more intricate rolls, and priced rather low. Take a look: kofusion.com/?page_id=255I didn't have any idea which would be the best, so I got the sampler (10 pieces, $10). Actually I got 2 orders :-)It's a little hard figuring out which piece was which sometimes, but the bartender offered to help me several times, and they left the menu with me, which I thought was a nice touch, so I could cross-reference what I was eating. The sushi was totally worth it.  Reading the other reviews, the only thing I can surmise is that the bad reviews came from people who had to wait too long, or maybe the staff has been changed recently. I had no problem with anyone there; the hostess, the two bartenders who served me, and a woman, who may have been the owner(?) who came and very nicely asked me to move one barstool over so she could seat a party of two next to eachother.Parking is a problem here as with anywhere near the university. There was a sign on the door saying they validate 2 hour parking for a parking lot, but since I didn't know that, didn't know where the lot was, and had already fed the meter on the street, I didn't think anything of it.The decor was nice, especially against the backdrop of the other restaurants I had been in since driving around eastern Illinois and western Indiana for the past few days.Go to Kofusion and get sushi- you won't regret it.

<Content> I really only go here for the $1 sushi night, can get pretty pricey otherwise. Love the monday night sushi specials, they make up a menu of 10 rolls that may not be traditional but are absolutely delicious like a grilled kobe beef roll or a roll topped with salsa. I always order the "sampler", a hot sake, and some edamame to start off. They also have more traditional stuff for purists and a large organic menu of seafood-restaurant-style dishes.Haven't found any other sushi place in town that is as good. And it has a really cool almost over-trendy atmosphere, so it's a place you can go to for a special occasion or just whenever.

<Content> I have been here many times for the $1 sushi as well as the lunch buffet.For the $1 sushi, the Big Roll is a must. It's convenient that if you order and are still hungry, you can order some more- even if it's only a couple pieces. It's a great way to test out some of their menu options without breaking your bank.The lunch buffet is outstanding- they always offer 3 types of sushi in addition to edamame, spring/egg rolls, rice, and chicken & beef dishes. It's hard to pick what to put on your plate.The specialty cocktails are pretty good too, if a little pricey.Overall, if you get a deal it's worth it, but I've definitely had better sushi.

She recognizes us when we come in, greets us warmly and always has a nice word to say. The food is fresh, portions are ample and taste is delicious.

<Content> Don't care about the decor or anything. I've only gone on Sunday/Monday so I can't speak to the restaurant on Tuesday-Saturday. At the same time, I'll probably keep going. I really like the tuna crunch roll, like a lot. As oddly specific as this might be, it is in my top 5 pieces of sushi ever. The bulk of my 10-12 pieces usually consist of these guys. I also enjoy the wagyu beef and BBQ pork roll, which are sort of a nice change up. People also seem to enjoy the big roll, though I take a pass because I'm not a fan of mushrooms.OK, so that necessarily doesn't earn the 4 star rating. It's good, relatively inexpensive (unless you're trying to eat 392 pieces) and the location is good. What gets the extra star is that the service is always on point and great. Knowing that people cherry picking what types of sushi they want can cause an error prone environment, the servers (and I suppose cooks/sushi-makers) usually get it right. When they don't, it's fixed quickly.Awesome!

<Content> Ok, there's no denying how much we all love the Big Roll. It's why we all eat here. When I worked at Aroma I would get dollar sushi to go every Sunday. And any aroma employee from 2010-2011 will attest that my order was wrong EVERY time. When I say "every" I sincerely mean every single time. There was once that I had the best service of my life, but that was about 4 years ago. Recently I was home and went on a Sunday afternoon. Our waitress was so bad. After we had been seated for 15 min my buddy asked the host if anyone was going to wait on us. A girl came over and flatly took our drink order. After we bagan eating my same buddy had to flag the girl down every time we needed our drinks refilled. Maybe she was having a really bad day in her personal life....because she was not interested in being a waitress whatsoever. The food was good tho. Lol.And while we got shitty service it prompted us to all swap horror stories we've heard about the owner. Seems everyone in town knows someone who worked here for like a day...Or was hired at an interview and never contacted again. And is the owner un aware that the cheap plastic crap in the fish tanks looks like crystal dildos? Everyone I've taken here comments in the penises in the fish tanks.God damn it.....I'll be back....you'll be back......we just love that Big Roll for $1!!!!!!!!

<Content> Best place for sushi. Ever. It can be a little pricey but that's why you go on Sundays or Mondays when its $1 a piece. I've tried the steak and noodles here which are really good too. But my favorite is still the sushi. The service can be slow when the place is packed, but I've never had anything worse than that. The deserts are really really good too. Go for the creme brulee or the fried cheesecake. This is definitely a place to go to on a date or when you're in the mood to go out with friends at night. Has a classy yet casual feel to it.

<Content> Diners beware!!! I have never been to a restaurant that so blatantly tried to up-sell everything! The rolls are really pretty big but the waitress suggested 2 rolls per person, The menu doesn't give you a clue as to how large the rolls are so it is really easy to fall for the suggestion. The waitress gave us a bunch of recommendations. Essentially, the waitress told us that every roll over $17 is "REALLY good". Some were & some weren't. Of course, the waitress suggested dessert. We passed.The restaurant offers various specials, including an Asian buffet until 1:30 pm on Saturdays. I would highly recommend finding out what the specials are and planning your visit based on the specials. The lobster roll WAS really tasty but PASS on the flaming phoenix roll. If I go again I will order 1 roll at a time & see how that goes. The place is expensive enough without the wait staff trying to upsell at every turn. I'm still irritated by the tactics

<Content> All I can say is, this place much too overpriced for what it's trying to sell. You leave feeling like you were ripped off rather than satisfied. Sushi was very below average and I found the selection of nigiri sparse. I don't think it would have been as upsetting if it wasn't so expensive, but even if were priced less, I still cannot say that it was delicious. My bf and I had one drink, one $15-16 maki roll (only five pieces on the plate though), nigiri (2 pieces at 2 bucks a piece), and sushi plate B (which had very few actual sushi for the price) and it was around $70 something. I could not believe it because that was my grocery bill for the whole week and I got a measly meal. We both left still feeling empty in the stomach. I'm not a super chef, but I know how to cook and even to make sushi myself. The rice used was not right. Sushi rice is not the rice you just scoop out of your pot or rice cooker rolled into shapes. There is a preparation process for the rice which adds rice wine vinegar, sweetness, and brings out a slight chewiness that complements the raw fishes and whatnots. KoFusion didn't even do this.The fish was not very flavorful either. The amount of rice used for the nigiri was about 2/3 the proper amount. Rolls were shot with a shrink ray. Everything was just off. The decor was really, I dunno ... just very odd. It's the like uncool kid trying to be really cool. There was neon, walls with bubbles, odd colors, tiles, weird blue lighting, odd shapes. I dunno, maybe this is what is "trendy" back then or something but it looks really odd to me. The waiters were fine. i was surprised to hear that our waiter has worked there for over two years. She knew what she was doing. I'm not looking for heaping portions, exquisite tastes at dirt cheap prices. I just want a good portioned meal, tastes good to the average person, and at a reasonable price. KoFusion missed the mark on all of them. Maybe it was just that night or because of new management. I remember KoFusion actually used to be good several years ago. I was shocked to see how different the quality of food that is being served now. Small portion, wallet shrinking, bland and poorly made sushi. Oh and odd decor.

<Content> Although KoFusion claims to sell only wild-caught seafood, this is not true. For example, they serve Kona kampachi, which is the brand name for a fish sold by a farm in Hawaii. On top of that, they do not label which fish is farmed and which is wild. So, the only thing you can do is ask. And, I would also ask whether the meat you're ordering is actually organic, because if the restaurant is willing to mislead their customers about the fish, I wouldn't trust them about the meat either! Why anyone would want to patronize a restaurant that has so little respect for the customers that it lies to them about about what's on the menu?

<Content> The sushi here is excellent. Very high marks for the mango coconut roll, it was FANTASTIC (with the added bonus of being one of the more reasonably priced items on the menu). I would have given 4 stars, but our waitress recommended a specialty roll that wasn't on the menu, she said it was her favorite, so we gave it a try. It was very spicy, and it was about $4 or $5 more than any other roll on the menu. It would have been nice if she disclosed both of those facts while recommending it.

<Content> Okay, I know it isn't close to STL, but if you're ever in the Champaign- Urbana area you must check this place out. First of all, they only serve organic meats and wild-caught seafood. Second of all, the menu is amazing- so many choices! Small plates, sushi, entrees, great appetizers, wine list, etc. We started with edamame and a dragon roll, I had a vegetable stir-fry (b/c I was feeling kind of basic) and they had wild boar on special that was delicious and not gamey at all (I had to try a bite of a friends'). The open floor plan, changing lights and fish tanks make this place a fun place to sit and have a meal, too. Our waiter was one of the nicest guys I've talked to in a long time, and he was quick with a refill or a table clear. Also, this place serves a delicious mojito made with sake instead of rum. Best drink ever!

<Content> I've been to Kofusion for lunch twice now. Both times I have enjoyed the food and the ambiance. My favorite is the Big Roll. Although, they really need to hire better servers (or train them better.) Not impressed with their knowledge or service manner.

<Content> I really love Ko Fusion, but first let me explain why I have an issue with how people rate this restaurant. They are rating it based on Dollar Sushi Night! Dollar sushi is a special discount night, and as such will be a different dining experience then typical dining hours. Its not an "off" night its just a different dining experience than a Saturday, and yes I'm sure the servers are more frazzled on these busier nights. Also, people who rate on just the sushi alone need to realize that this is only a portion of the menu. I love the sushi here, but I also love the creations of chef Nigel. I have been here dozens of times in my undergrad years and it was always memorable. The owner might have high standards in her servers, but that's because she expects high standards in everything in her restaurants. The bathrooms are immaculate! The food is incredible! The drinks are amazing and inventive! Really, this place has such a warm spot in my heart. For the middle of Illinois, it doesn't get more creative and amazing than this. Love Ko Fusion!

<Content> Great sushi and I especially love dollar sushi nights (sunday and monday nights). Everything seems really fresh and the sushi rolls are a bit more inventive than other sushi places in the area. A little on the pricy side for most of the week. Great atmosphere, service can be a little slow earlier in the afternoon, or during dollar sushi nights (it's always really busy).

<Content> The atmosphere here is terrific. The interior is replete with huge fish tanks with lights that keep changing colors, and a waterfall. They also have a large outdoor garden.My boyfriend lives in NYC and Chicago for many years, and says that this is the best sushi he has ever had.I normally order a korean noodle dish. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are wonderful, but they use chili oil instead of fresh chilis, so it makes it too greasy.If you adore chocolate, you must must must order the Valhrona chocolate gelato. You will realize you have never really eaten "chocolate" before!The service can be a little slow, even when the restaurant is not busy, but the servers are knowledgeable and friendly.

<Content> I went there for lunch and did not partake in the buffet. My parties food took FOREVER!!! I was told it was because we did not order the buffet even though we ordered before most of the other parties were sat. Lunch took almost two hours. Unacceptable! No apology and preferential treatment was given to other tables. The food was mediocre at best. Won't be going there again.

<Content> I received a recommendation to eat here from the driver at my hotel. She loved a specific salad and thought I might enjoy the restaurant. I arrived to a beautiful restaurant with a friendly staff. I moved outside, as the night was warm. I ordered wine and asked the server to return so that I could order my appetizer. The restaurant was virtually empty, but she took a very long time. Eventually, I placed my order. I received my dinner before my appetizer. I ordered the seafood cheese springroll. It was not good. There is no other way to say it. It tasted like cream cheese in a spring roll. The crab and pollack was missing in action. I couldnt finish it and the server never asked me how it was. The entree itself, a stirfry dish with panang curry was delicious. It wasnt the best I've tasted, but it was still very good. Now..with my wine glass empty and half of my entree gone, I waited for the server to order more wine. She never came. After 20 minutes, I got up and asked the hostess for my server. The hostess was going home so couldnt help me. I waited a bit more and then asked again for the waitress. After half an hour, a young lady came out and said, I'm sorry but your server went home. The manager never came out to explain. No one asked if I needed or wanted anything. She just said, your server went home and gave me a check. I looked at the bill and realized that she had overcharged me. The seafood yuck was on the menu for $8, but she charged me $10. Then, I had to wait for her to call the manager and for him to fix the bill. Still, he did not appear in this very empty restaurant. He called from the back and said I fixed it. He took $5.00 off instead of the overcharge of $2.00. Perhaps this was to placate me. How about, Oh, I'm so sorry that we sent your server home without giving you another server. Oh, you didnt like the seafood springroll, can we get you something else instead. Nothing. I left the restaurant and determine that I would never go back again. It was definitely below the level of a good restaurant. Below fair as well. I guess this means poor.

<Content> Went here when we were visiting some friends at U of I & ... I'm sorry, but for their prices, the sushi could be A LOT better. I'm not really a sushi snob and I'm definitely down for paying a good amount of money for really good sushi. This place gave me mediocre sushi for a higher price. No thanks. Also, they messed up my order & this chef (who literally looked like he just rolled out of bed b/c he looked so disheveled) gave me a lecture about their fish & how I was mistaken. If I wanted a lecture with my food, I'd go to class & eat. Relearn how to treat your customers, make your sushi taste amazing & present it in a way where I want to cry... then I'll come back. Till then, I'd rather just eat cocomero all day when I'm there.

<Content> I have a couple of things to say about this place. First - this place is light years better than Miko, even thought they're owned by the same people. That doens't say much, however, since Miko's food sucks big time. I love Ko Fusion sushi - it's creative and the ingredients are top notch. But seriously, the price is ridiculous considering Sushi Kame makes rolls almost as good for half the price and none of the attitude. The fish entrees are always good here, but stay away from non-asian dishes - especially pastas or anything Italian. You would do better with a frozen dinner and I'm not kidding!

<Content> I've only been here for dollar sushi, so keep that in mind. I actually like the sushi here. The service has been mostly good. You'd think the wait would be crazy, but I've not really had to wait very long. They get you in and out, but it doesn't feel rushed. And $10 for a full sushi dinner is pretty good in my books. I want to try on another night, just to check out the entrees.

<Content> I would not recommend going to this place any other nights/days then Sunday & Monday which is when most of their sushi/maki rolls are only $1 each! The food here is amazing! I would highly recommend the big roll and the volcano, my two favorites. I could probably live off of it. Their miso soup is excellent, and for desert try the red bean ice cream, sounds strange, but its delicious! They also have a great selection of martinis to pick from. The service is always iffy, but the last couple times we have lucked out with good servers. But either way you can usually find me here on a Sunday or Monday getting my fill of yummy yummy sushi!

<Content> Overpriced and underwhelming. Atmosphere leaves much to be desired - imagine an 80's dance club with an underwater theme- filled with CU's yuppies who think this is the place to "See and Be Seen." We went for "Dollar Sushi" - each BITE is $1...not each roll. I know sushi can be expensive, but I thought it would be something more of "Chef's Choice" trying to use up what wasn't purchased over the weekend. You're better off going a different night to avoid the crowds and just order the rolls you like. The rolls themselves were decent, but not the best I've had.

<Content> This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Champaign. I spent four years in C-U, and came back here several times, most of which for Dollar Roll Night.Although many reviews have said that the service is slow, particularly on Dollar Roll Nights (Sunday and Monday nights), I have never had this experience. I would go with a friend or six, and the service was always fast enough that no one would really complain. Prices are a bit on the high side, but the quality of the food justifies that, both on and off the Sushi menu. Seriously though, the non-sushi menu is very good and highly underrated.If there is one drawback to Ko-Fusion, it is that it can get very noisy during dinner service, particularly on Dollar Roll Nights. However, the food is good, the service is not as bad as people make it out to be, and the food justifies the prices.

<Content> In terms of sushi quality, they are good. However, their rolls are overly complicated and portions are small. Their prices are too high. You are paying for the raver club scene atmosphere when you go here. The service is annoying in that they are always too busy for you, act like the atmosphere (pompous), and will relentlessly try to upsell you into appetizers and drinks. And good luck getting seated during dollar sushi nights. I much prefer Sushi Kame just around the corner - which has great food, great service, great prices, and a low key atmosphere.

My favorite is definitely the Fusion Maki though it is a little pricey. I definitely think it's worth the price because it's a meal in itself. Also, they have a great $1 sushi deal on Sundays and Mondays. The menu is a little pricey though if you're not going on their $1 sushi nights.

On top of that they didn't bother to look that we didn't have any chop sticks!! The sushi was only ok for a dollar a piece. For all of that I might as well only get sushi from Siam Terrace where they have $5 sushi rolls (6 pieces).

<Content> I used to work here, so I can say from the perspective of the kitchen that the quality of food is quite high. All the meat is bought from small organic farms that the chef researched. In the case of the chicken, we used to get it from Mahomet, just down the road. Everything came in fresh. If the place was out of chicken, we didn't have chicken. No running to the grocery store and lowering quality just to keep it on the menu for the night. I definitely witnessed a great deal of dedication to the food by the head chef, and if anything makes the place expensive, it's that dedication to always serve the finest ingredients. That being said, I can only apply that to the kitchen that prepared the entrees, or cooked food. The sushi obviously must travel some distance to get to Champaign, but the quality is the highest that can be expected that many miles from the ocean. So if your looking for a place that will prepare simple, elegant meals using top ingredients and organic meat, this is your place.

The environment is pretty cool too- and you can sit outside. If you are sushi lover, this is the place to go to in champaign. For people who dont like sushi, they also have just plain food that's great as well. Great Date Place Too!!! Can get a little pricey depending on what you order, but for the most part, the food is worth it. Never had a bad experience there.

<Content> I tried this place last night with my girls for the $1 sushi. I was a little worried after hearing mixed reviews on yelp and in person, but was pleasantly surprised. Our server was probably the most attentive I've had so far in C-U, but I don't know if that was because it wasn't very busy (the undergrads haven't gotten back to campus yet) or because I was with 5 very attractive female grad students. In any case, drinks were always kept filled and the sushi came very promptly. There are drink specials also on Monday nights: $3.50 bottles of sake and $4 glasses of wine, about 4 each to choose from. We had the hot sake and I had a glass of the Riesling, which was nicely balanced (not too sweet.. very nice for sushi). There were ten rolls available for $1, and we were not required to order all ten of them. I tried one of each except for the organic beef and the alfredo roll. My favorites were the big roll and the crunch roll, which was topped with a nice spicy sauce. The rolls were not very large for being "special" rolls, and I definitely would not order one from the regular menu (some were listed as high as $23 for one roll?). It was really fun to go and pick and choose and compare with my friends though. I will be back for $1 night! With wine, sushi, and tip, I spent $23 and was stuffed!

<Content> This restaurant always sounded like it would be a great place to impress guests or a date. On my last night in Champaign, I finally decided to go in and give it a try. The room was dark and with an impressive modern feel. The music was not too loud and they had a tv screen with changing background art (like you would see on iTunes but a little better). The other tv had the Bulls game so my eyes often wandered away from my date and to this tv (sorry, sweetie). The server was prompt and provided the specials. I decided to go with the Tuna rolls (the standard which I compare these kinds of restaurants) and the chicken stir-fry. The tuna rolls had the largest diameter of meat that I have seen in C-U and it was of a good quality. My only complaint was the meagerness of the serving but they made up for it with a lot of meat for each roll and the neat stacked arrangement of the rolls. The stir fry I really enjoyed! All of their meat dishes seemed to accommodate those who want free-range and humanely treated livestock. For the price and the hype, I was somewhat satisfied. I still think Sushi Kame is the better place to go for Japanese food and sushi and it is not as crowded and loud. However, if you really want to impress out-of-town guests, you go to Kofusion and not Kame.

<Content> I always laugh when people tell me that their favorite place for sushi is Ko-fusion. I have been there 4 times and each time, I was quite disappointed in the food. The first time I went there my friends dragged for "dollar sushi" night. I thought I was getting robbed more than saving money, the pieces they give you are very small. The only reason why is its a dollar is because you have to eat like 10 pieces to fill up. The second time I went in there, we ordered a few rolls, and they took quite a while, when I looked over at the customers next to us, it looked like what we ordered, turned out it was. The girls were like, "this is not what we ordered and had sat on there table for 5 mins before the waitress came and brought it to our table,at that point we just ate and left, she didnt even get a tip. The 2 other times were just as bad, I'll save you time and money, and tell you to try the other sushi places in town.

<Content> I love this place. They have some very unique sushi but they also have some boring ones. So long as you order right, the sushi is amazing. I recommend the flaming red dragon ( i think that is what it was called). The stir fry is also superb. Service is great also.

<Content> My girlfriend and I thought this place was pretty good. Seeing that everyone was complaining about the prices and saying that it was overrated, we came in with low expectations. We only had sushi off the $1 menu and some how we ended up spending over $50 (we ordered Nobilo wine and a few appetizers as well). We enjoyed the sushi so much that we got a second order of sushi. Being from California, the prices of the sushi were really no surprise to us. The place was pretty clean and the decor was very modern. There was seating out side but my girlfriend and I still haven't acclimated to the humidity so we resorted to the indoor conditioning. Overall, a pretty cool, trendy place to get a sushi fix if you need it.

<Content> I always enjoy the food, very tasty sushi! I enjoy the lunch buffet, even better than Miko's used to be. The dollar sushi on Sunday and Monday is pretty decent, too.

<Content> GREAT lunch buffet! I can't say anything didn't taste really good....they had an assortment of salad, fried rice, egg rolls, chicken dish, pork dish, seafood cakes, bean donuts, a couple sushi rolls. Definitely worth trying for $10!

<Content> The restaurant definately looks elegant and is impressive. It is clear why it was voted best date place in champaign. The menu is interesting, expensive, and not kid friendly, though that appears intentional, since they want big checks, not big families.Veggie option on the menue I had was tofu veggie stirbfry, but when it came, it had zero tofu. strange given the dish was called tofu vegetable stirfry. The waiter never checked in on us after our food arrived until we were finished. He showed me an updated menu in which there was no tofu in the stir fry, too bad I had an old menu - he didn't appologize, just said that he will make sure to remove the old menus from the stack. thanks... My daughter liked the dumplings and california roll. the edamame are served with sesame oil, which is a nice touch. The waiter refilled my daughter's lemonade with ice water - thanks for that, too.... My son objected when he tried to fill his sprite with water . My son and wife liked the steak. Dessert was good according to my kids though they didn't finish it, so it couldn't have been that good. I've not seen them fail to finish chocolate cake before. In all, it's over priced, decent food with not so great service, but excellent ambiance. Great for impressing your date, but not necessarily great food or service.

<Content> We have complete household agreement on five stars here. Came here last night for an impromptu nice dinner and sat on the patio enjoying the warm summer evening. Yes, the food is pricey for Champaign. We had sushi, the special steak, and two salads, a smoked calamari salad and a Prairie Fruits goat cheese salad. The salads were excellent. The sushi is the best in Champaign (and you pay for it, because it is fresher, hence higher transportation costs). My strip steak was one of the best composed steaks I have ever had: lovely sauce, perfect accompaniments, nicely cooked (cf. steakhouse steaks, which I also love, which are a big hunk of meat, grilled, w/ some kind of potato on the side -- go to Jim Gould's if you are in the mood for that kind of meat in Champaign). Nice, small list of wines by the glass. Delicious creme brule: best ever, any restaurant. Knowledgeable, attentive service. Only quibble, my idea of rare is rarer than their idea of rare, but their rare worked very well with the steak and the sauce.
