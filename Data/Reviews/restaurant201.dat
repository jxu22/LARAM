<Content> This is my favorite place in C-U for a quick, cheap lunch. I always get the falafel sandwich combo ($6), which isn't anything mind-blowing but also never disappoints. Atmosphere is very relaxed and the restaurant is never too crowded -- I am always comfortable here. The guy at the counter is pretty stony-faced, but he's always polite. When you order he'll give you a number that (as far as I can tell) is totally random. I wonder if there's some kind of secret pattern to them...

<Content> I'm new to the area and wanted to try the local middle eastern cuisine, as back home I am blessed with a nice variety of it in the southwest suburbs.I went into the (just about empty) Jerusalem Restaurant and looked over the menu before being silently greeted by the notorious owner. I stepped up to order and he turned his back, apparently cooking someone else's food. I patiently waited and eventually ordered the daily special of kufta, salad and hummus. After observing my meal being cooked and assembled, I dashed home to try it.I opened up everything and was initially let down by the quantity I received for about $9. I started with the salad which looked to be a combination of many different vegetables including onions, celery, carrots, spices and a couple of other unrecognizable things. Even though there was a large array of different ingredients for this salad, it was unbelievably bland and some of the vegetables pretty hard in consistency. I couldn't figure out why, there was some kind of a dressing on it, but it wasn't much more than some type of oil, maybe a really light olive? I'm not sure. It then occurred to me that this salad was probably sitting for a very long time before I had eaten it. I wouldn't get it again.Next, my order came with Kufta (lamb & beef), 2 pitas and a very small dollop of hummus. The Kufta had a pretty unique flavor to it that I did like, but the quality of the meat was fair, at best. The pitas were decent but by far the best part of my dinner was the hummus. The hummus had a very nice taste and was complemented well by a splash of olive oil. It was not bland and definitely the highlight of my meal.Overall, I was disappointed having spent almost $. The portion size wasn't much, and the starch (pita) is really what filled me up.I will be back in sometime just to try something else and see if my review is consistent for all the food, rather than just what I had. This place has a variety of options and maybe I just picked the wrong one.

<Content> Not sure I'd evem give them 1 star..false advertising. Menu on Yelp states Lentil soup is made with Olive oil.  Upon driving out of way here I was informed by an authentic looking & sounding Soup Nazi that it's Soy oil. There will be NO soup for me here!

<Content> Very good food! The one guy that works there and takes the orders does a good job at cooking it all too. I always get the steak shawarma!He closes pretty early for dinner, so be sure to not get there within the last 15 or 20 minutes because he will only let you order it to-go.

<Content> Restaurant reviewDo you remember that episode in Seinfeld at the soup restaurant. I won't refer to the name given to the owner of that restaurant but this experience is very similar. You go up to the counter to order from a surly man who is cooking and running the register. He will ignore you for a few minutes and finally come over to take your order. You sit down and after a few more minutes or more he will yell your food is ready with only the bare minimum of words. Not the best customer service, but I digress. The upside is the food is inexpensive compared to chicago. There are daily specials. I ended up with the lamb dish with rice, split pea soup, and some beans. The flavors were very authentic, not too salty or spicy. I just wish the lamb was not cooked way through. For the price you pay it is good, but the food would not be acceptable restaurant quality in a big city. All said and done, I will be back if I crave Mediterranean food.Pro: inexpensive, authentic middle eastern foodCons: average food quality, overcooked, poor customer service, NO free refills...Hidden gem: Daily specials are a bargain, check out my picture for the menu

<Content> The complaints I've heard about this restaurant are numerous, ranging from bad food to the infamous Soup-Nazi-like owner. So why did I give it so many stars? Many people would hesitate before eating at Jerusalem Restaurant, and I can't blame them if they have been spoiled by American restaurant standards. In defense of these kinds of restaurants everywhere, I would argue that you have to be at least a little adventurous (and patient) when it comes to eating ethnic food. I've become a regular customer because Jerusalem Restaurant is just so STRANGE, and kind of endearing in its own way. I know that there are limitations to excusing poor service/attitude because of cultural differences, but I have never thought of the owner as malicious or incompetent. Every visit, one of my friends makes an attempt to get the owner to smile (I've witnessed it, and it is a truly uplifting sight).Below, I've documented some of my observations while eating there. I know that these are probably factors that cast the restaurant in a bad light, but personally, these are the type of experiences that have made me come to enjoy (at least for humor value) my visits to Jerusalem Restaurant. Read on:* I first came into Jerusalem Restaurant with friends, and we all decided to order the daily combination plate. When we got to the counter and placed our orders, the owner just asked each of us, "Meat or vegetable?" We all requested meat, assuming that we would just receive whatever he was making for the daily meat dish. To our confusion, when we received the meals, we each had been given a different meat: lamb, fish, and chicken! (We learned later that you can just request a specific meat.)* I have struggled to decipher the numbering logic used at this restaurant; this is the first example. When you look at the front counter, there are sheets of paper that show a condensed menu, just the most popular items served at lunch. Instead of writing Combo #1, Combo #2, etc., their items are listed as #576, #708, etc. (not even in sequential order!). * This is the second example involving weird numbers. After you order, the owner will write a number on a piece of scrap paper and hand it to you. This number is separate from the receipt, so it does not correspond to the price of your meal. My friend and I thought it over, and we interpreted this as the same system employed at fast food restaurants, where your number is called when your order is ready. When we looked, my number was 16 and my friend's was 28 (again, not sequential, even when he had ordered right after me). Then, when our food was finished, the owner just waved at us instead of calling our numbers. ...Huh?* Unlike most restaurants, the owner doesn't leave unlimited boxes of napkins at the silverware station or your table. Instead, he leaves just a few napkins (less than 10) at the front counter, so you always feel bad about taking more than necessary. Great economic/environmental tactic...?I'll briefly summarize a few more important points if you decide to try Jerusalem Restaurant: (1) Order the spiced hot tea in the winter, (2) the restaurant is only open for lunch, not dinner, and (3) no matter how much you're initially intimidated by the owner, he is actually a warm person once you become familiar with him.

<Content> Of all restaurants in Chambana, this is by far my favorite. I used to go several times as week for either lunch or dinner when I was still in the area. The food is homemade-like, which was always a big plus for me. I prefer to be on the healthy side, and Jerusalem offers that option with the bonus of being cheap. And this fact makes it unique in a college town, where most people are craving for cheap junk food.I would go most frequently for the "plate of the day" #202 with chicken. It is a big tray with an assortment of tasty items. So big, that sometimes you would end up saving half of it for dinner.I can more simply define Jerusalem as: tasty, tasty, tasty. Totally love it.Ah, yes, the owner. Some people complain about him. Well, after going for so many times, I found out he is a very warm person. He might not give you a fake smile the first time you walk into his restaurant, but he will give you a genuine smile the fifth time you go there.

<Content> I love this place!The food is without frills, has been great every time that I've visited, is served quickly, and is fairly priced (a little on the cheap side for CU). It's about the only place within a block of campus where I can get lunch for less than $5.The owner cracks me up. A lot of people complain that he's grumpy, unfriendly, a sourpuss, etc., but if you had to deal with obnoxious American college students all day long, you would be, too. Regardless, he is not rude, just not particularly talkative and probably too efficient at what he does. Bonus: every time that I've been in here, he's listening to NPR.

<Content> This is our favorite restaurant in Champaign, IL when we drive down.The food is very authentic and deliciious.  Haven't had a bad item here.The Baba Ganoush is delicious and the Dolmas are one of our favorites. The Chicken Kebob sandwich is outstanding. It is probably one of the worst looking restaurants I've seen inside all the way around, but it's fine.  It's still a great casual place to eat.Not sure if the man behind the counter is the owner.  He seems to be a good person, he recognizes us and with much effort sometimes we can get a few words out of him, but just has zero personality, no smile, no life to him, nothing.  It would be nice if he could be more outgoing and social, but might not be possible for him.  It's fine though.Service is slow, but again the food is authentic and delicious, so it's worth it.If you appreciate good quality food, then I'd highly recommend this place.If you are looking for fine dining in a modern restaurant, then you won't like it.

<Content> I want to love Jerusalem. I really, really do. Here are the reasons why I can't:The tabouli is the worst intentionally edible thing I've ever tasted. By any stretch of the imagination, if it were good, it should be called a tomato and cucumber salad. But it is awful.The rice tastes like Uncle Ben's instant rice.Here are the reasons why I gave it three stars:The grape leaves/dolma are delicious.The guy always seems stressed out and I feel empathy for him.Everything else there that I've tried is really just okay. My argument should be that it's fast and easy to get, but it's not because with just one employee during the day the service takes forever. I guess I just want to support the business in hopes that it will some day improve.

<Content> I always walk past this place but never thought of trying it because it looks kinda shady. It is usually pretty empty, lunch or dinner time. So, I have no clue how this place survives. One day, my friend ordered some falafel and grape leaves wrap for takeout just for the heck of it. She was a little unsure if she wanted to try them and I ended up being the scapegoat. The food wasn't fresh and my friend saw the guy reheating the food in a microwave instead of preparing them from scratch. The falafel ended up a little dry and the little leave wraps were sour. I was not sure if it was supposed to taste like that but I found it awful. Maybe I should try the shwarma instead.

<Content> The restaurant itself is small place, with a bad lighting. Looks like an old and unloved place by its owner. The owner usually has an attitude towards the customers! He's angry and look fiercely in your eyes, as if you shouldn't be there to taste his cooking! It is not irritating though, I feel it's more funny and something to laugh at with friends! It's a one man show by the way, he is the cook and the counter-holder. Works almost like a fast food, except for the fact that it is not fast! Now the food itself. I've had Shawerma here, as well as Falafel and some other stuff which I can't remember their names. By far, the meal you want to order in this restaurant is the Shawerma. Having said that, I prefer the Gyros from "Zorba's" which is just 2 minutes walking south of this place. They are more tender and juicy, and the bread in their Gyro is much better.

<Content> I know other reviewers took issue with the interior of the restaurant or the attitude of the owner, but I absolutely love Jerusalem for its excellent food. The hummus is to die for. So creamy! We usually get the dish of the day. All the vegetable dishes I've tried are very yummy (especially the spinach dish), and there are many options if you are a vegetarian. My personal favorite is the fish. It's fried tender and juicy without being greasy and seasoned perfectly with a hint of spiciness. The most important reason why I always prefer Jerusalem to other restaurant options in the area is that all dishes taste like home-made food, prepared according to traditional recipes with great care. It's cheap, but definitely not cheaply prepared!

<Content> I really like this place. It's inexpensive, quick, and always very filling. It's not the very best Middle Eastern food that I've ever had, but it's definitely up there. I usually order the lamb shawarma sandwich and a side of falafel. There are two men who work there, and both are pretty serious, but it doesn't bother me.

<Content> Wonderful hummus and everything else, too! Take your chances with the plate of a day, it's a bargain and an adventure! And you'll get delightful hummus, pita, salad and rice along with the special items of the day. The service can be a little slow since it's ONE MAN running the show but he takes his time with each person's order and serves up tasty plates! The Arabian tea is also delish!

<Content> Ordered the grape leaves appetizer + lamb/beef shawarma plate with rice and vegetables (the other option was pita/hummus). The plate came with a side choice of soup or salad - we went with lentil soup. After tax the total was $16 something. A bit on the pricey side compared to places like this in the northern suburbs of Chicago but the food was tasty and the crowd was diverse. I would have preferred everything to be a little less salty. For 2 people that was enough food. We left very full, satisfied, and thirsty. I would come back to try their sandwiches.

Rest of food being mediocre. Passed by this place every day, went in to check it out at the suggestion of a friend. Though I had friends who went there often, I didn't go back, and don't really plan to.

<Content> Being unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food, I was slightly intimidated by the place when I first entered. But, I had tried dolmas before, and knew that should be a safe choice. I ordered the appetizer portion, and was pleasantly surprised when my order came with a sample portion of potatoes and a cucumber-mint salad. All of it was delicious! This week I returned, and decided to try something else. After examining the descriptions in the menu I settled on tabouli and a samosa. Both exceeded my expectations. I am now hooked on tabouli, and am a fan of this restaurant. I intend to make it a weekly lunch-time stop. As for the owner, he seems quiet, but was very patient and pleasant with me. He also seemed approving of the selections I made on my second visit. It does take a while for the orders to come out, but I'm usually not in a big hurry when I go to a sit-down restaurant anyway. I enjoy the place and the people, and don't mind being there, in the calm, listening to NPR. It's a nice change of pace.
