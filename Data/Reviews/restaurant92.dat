<Content> An alright restaurant - friendly and quick staff in a spacious setting but the food isn't anything special. In this trip I tried 4 different items.Chicago 7 pizza: Good thing about this pizza is that it was loaded with toppings (Green peppers, Italian sausage, red onions, Pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.) -- but the sauce was a bit too sour and it could have used additional cheese. The crust itself was tasteless and too hard to chew -- not really what you'd find in any of the great Chicago pizza restaurants.Classic wings -- Light and crispy but really lacking in flavor and meat juciness. The dish itself is too dependent on the sauce to have any flavor.Molten chocolate cake -- Not really a lava cake but the fudge was nice and rich and went well with the ice cream.The big cookie -- Wasn't great, wasn't bad -- the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie dough was a bit on the dry side and ice cream is almost mandatory otherwise the dish is too plain.Overall, the prices aren't bad and the portion sizes are good but the execution of the food could be improved.

<Content> The pizza is always good, but when management allows them to reuse coasters to the point of them being moldy on the table, it makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is.

<Content> This place touts itself as a beer bar but the selection was substandard for any serious beer aficionado. I opted instead for an Arnold Palmer. My BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger was decent but the fries were off. They tasted like they had been waiting around for awhile. My buddy liked his thin crust pizza. I doubt I'll return to this place. In Champaign-Urbana, there are much better burgers (Farren's) and much better beer bars (Crane Alley, Seven Saints, Radio Maria). Old Chicago just doesn't cut it.

<Content> I went at lunch and had the pizza bar because I wanted to try their different pizzas. The thin crust one was just OK. The thick crust was a little better. They had a Mexican thick crust which was interesting. I also tried the Stromboli and I really liked it. A soup or salad is included with the pizza bar. The server will bring you the salad. They make their own ranch dressing and that's a plus in my book. You get a chocolate chip cookie with your ticket. And it is really good. This is NOT Chicago style pizza. I'm not sure why they chose that name. Unless there is something I am not aware of. When I go to Chicago I have Chicago style pizza like Gino's. Now that's a Chicago style pizza!

<Content> If zero stars were available I'd give this "joint" zero. The wait staff is well trained and actually competent; the bad news is that they can only serve what the kitchen prepares.Our orders:Appetizer for 2 - artichoke & spinach dip. Served in a round smallish soup type bowl, this awful tasting, white looking glop that looked to have been slopped in the bowl with a large kitchen spoon should have been a clue as to what was to follow. We didn't eat any of it nor we're we offered a refund on this unbelievably bad dish.Main course - "Tuscan" pizza, deep dish (what the hell. It's supposed to be a "Chicago" place, no?) We were lead to believe that, among other things, the pizza would be served with sauted spinach and chicken breast. What was delivered arrived with approx 5 to 6 leaves if spinach in the center and some rock hard "chicken" bites that I'd bet dollars to donuts was what's known as "chunked and formed."Later that night I had, shall we say, terrible gastric distress.SO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE!!

<Content> I got what I expected when I went to this restaurant......above average deep dish Chicago style pizza. I really liked the atmosphere of the sports bar/pizza joint. This would be a great place to go to watch the game. All in all the food is good, but slightly overpriced in my opinion.

<Content> You know, despite the name and all that, I never really expected authentic Chicago style pizza here. So, while I can understand the disappointment voiced in several reviews here, I didn't feel it myself.I've only gotten the "Chicago-style" pizza here, but like I said, I wasn't expecting Lou Malnati's. I was expecting a normal pizza with a thick crust. Like the deep dish at Domino's or Pizza Hut. I don't know why, that's just how it was. And that's exactly what I got. And I'll be honest, it tastes like a more flavorful Pizza Hut pizza. I don't really know what to say besides that. It's not the best pizza, but it's not the worst. And sometimes you just get a craving for pizza like this.Just don't go in expecting something great and you'll be fine.

<Content> Meh. Old Chicago changed their pizza menu and it's definitely not as good. Their new "Tavern style" pizza is basically a less-good version of their NY-style pizza (which they no longer sell). Both mine and my friend's pizzas were really salty. Wasn't impressed.One of my biggest food-service pet peeves is staff who don't know what they're talking about. I understand that just because you work somewhere doesn't mean you have all the answers--but if you don't know something, you shouldn't just LIE to the customer. I asked our waitress if the Specialty pizzas were included in the half-off deal for Tuesday nights. She said yes. We got our bill--which she checked before giving to us--and I paid. Of course, after we left I realized that our bill was about $5 too high. Because the 50% hadn't been taken off my pizza. Because specialty pizzas aren't included in the half off deal. Won't be back to Old Chicago--not a fan of how they've changed their pizza, and the mistake on the bill was enough to keep me from returning.

<Content> My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out because we love pizza. All I can say is that the pizza was about as good as the service. The food really wasn't that great at all, and the wait staff didn't really tend to their guests as they should. We did a lot of waiting around for our waitress and witnessed some really unprofessional behavior while there. We definitely won't be returning.

<Content> Old Chicago is a chain restaurant I never knew existed, even though I'm from the Chicago area. Oh wait, that's because Old Chicago has NOTHING to do with the city of Chicago itself. It's based in Boulder, Colorado. This would explain why the "Chicago-Style Pizza" was...not Chicago-style. Yes, it's pizza baked in a pan, with a thickish crust, but when the sauce is not on top, it's not Chicago-style. GET IT RIGHT OR PAY THE PRICE (to quote a favorite childhood TV show).Moving on. I perused the website before we went, and was excited to see that on Thursday nights, they have $2.50 pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris. I mean, $2.50?? Hell yeah! See below:oldchicago.com/champaignWhen I mentioned these specials to the waitress, she looked dumbstruck. After checking with her manager, she came back and said all they had were margaritas. I sighed and said, sure, I'd have a margarita. When she brought it, she informed me that she'd only charge me $2.50 for that one, but nothing else, because they didn't do specials anymore. I responded that that was fine, but maybe they should TAKE THE SPECIALS OFF THEIR WEBSITE? I mean, just a thought. Oh wellz, the margarita was gross anyway.The one redeeming thing about Old Chicago is that it has a ridiculous beer selection. Like, in the triple digits. I have to respect that. Otherwise, this place is pretty mediocre.

<Content> I went here last night because of the Yelp check in offer, and me wanting to try a new restaurant. It was okay, decent or I think I'm more incline to say so so. The service is good, and our waitress was so kind that although she said she can't use the yelp offer on all checks (because they were split checks), she did so. The food is so so for me. First we had the trio sampler appetizer, the cicilian pepperoni roll is quite good, and the itallian nachos taste more like crab rangoon minus the crab stick, but that two was the best one for me. The pizza, taste okay, but I didn't eat the deep dish one, so I couldn't judge on the pizza. Lastly we got the captain's catch which was also taste so so, really didn't leave much impression on me

<Content> This was the first chicago-style pizza I tried during my stay in IL... I've had Pizza Uno's before, but I really enjoyed my eats @ Old Chicago!We ordered the Double Deckerini....which had lots of pepperoni & hot sauce!Despite it being over-priced then it should have been, I really enjoyed the pizza! I mean, I still think Pappa Del's is the best Chicago-style pizza I had during my stay in Champaign, but Old Chicago comes in close #2! ;)

<Content> I've only done the lunch buffet here, so that's what my review will be for. It's cool they have a huge beer selection. The lunch pizza buffet comes with soup/salad, the buffet which has breadsticks, some kind of stramboni things, and various mix of pizzas. they give you a choc-chip cookie for dessert. The pizza is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best in town, or "chicago" style pizza. The buffet sometimes doens't have any "normal" pizza up there. Ususally you can ask the waitress to request they make a certain pizza though. But sometimes they have some very weird stuff up there like cheeseburger pizza, pinapple and ham, or whatever they feel like on any given day. Also it seems they always want to put me on the farthest side away from the buffet as possible on lunch even when there are a ton of open tables around the lunch buffet (which most people get during lunch hours). I hate having to walk aroudn the entire bar to get to the buffet. I realize I could just ask to sit closer, but when I tell the hostess 2 for the bufet, I almost want to see where they will sit me, and they always sit me the farthest booth away from the buffet as possible.

<Content> Old Chicago is a Chambana favorite of my friends and I. We usually end up going on Tuesdays because pizza is priced half off, and we are poor college students. Overall, the food is pretty good and the atmosphere is nice when it isn't completely crowded. It is a chain restaurant, so don't expect unique gourmet cooking. The 'Chicago-style' pizza is more like a standard thick crust pizza as opposed to REAL Chicago-style pizza. Try Papa Del's or Amano's if you're looking for more legit Chicago-style pizza.All that aside, Old Chicago is a nice place to go with friends and/or family. I have usually had good service, and there is a full bar if you want a drink or two. The prices are a little steep if you don't go on Tuesdays though. PROS: Cheap on Tuesdays, decent food, pretty good service, family-friendly atmosphereCONS: Pricey on most days, NOT real Chicago-style pizza, loud when restaurant is crowded

<Content> I was pleasantly surprised, though my expectations were low. They were lowered further by the atmosphere/decor. This chain restaurant is indeed offensive on many levels to a person from Chicago: typical corporate chain restaurant wall flair is everywhere, and that schlock is indeed Chicago themed. There is a scoreboard that looks like Wrigley's, a sign for Rush Street, and everywhere you look are old timey pics of landmarks etc. etc. This in and of itself would not be so bad, but the fact that the chain so buttfucks the idea of Chicago deep dish pizza is irredeemable. The thing that they call deep dish likely has most of the ingredient groups of a Chicago Style pizza, but it is so unlike a Chicago Style pizza I refuse to discuss it anymore for fear I will throw my keyboard in rage. A quick look at their corporate website and you will note that this place has dozens, if not hundreds of locations, with only one in Chicagoland (Elk Grove, on the Iowa side of O'Hare).So why does this patently offensive joint get an 'A-OK'? The thin crust pizza was pretty good. It was not New York Style, but the cheese had the same saltiness and was cooked to perfection: crispy, with slightly orange cheese, and served hot as hell but not yet burnt. I had it with basil and roasted garlic, which were chopped up and added under the cheese and complimented the pizza very well. Their Cheesy Garlic bread is absolutely divine; I have to get that again next time. They also have beer. Basically every mainstream domestic and popular import you have ever heard of. About 30 on tap. Not as many obscure micros and craft beers as you will find at the Pig and Crane Alley or even at Radio Maria, Boltini and Seven Saints, but it is a great selection for a chain restaurant. Kinda disappointing in that regard, but understandable as this is obviously a company that buys thousands, if not millions of barrels yearly and is not interested in getting a cask here and there.I went on Tuesday night, when they have 1/2 price pizzas and $2.99 Two Brothers' Beers. This made the meal much more palatable. My 14" thin crust pizza full price would have been about $15-16 with 2 toppings, which is a little much for a pizza that feeds two (they say 2-3, but dont do that to yourself). Service was great. Jacob (Jake) was attentive, efficient, and accurate. He was courteous and intuited our needs. We were playing trivia there via the NTN boxes, so of course he always seemed to come by when a question was being asked, but that is just how life seems to work.They have a ton of TVs, most of which are flatscreen HD. They also have a bunch of very high quality video games including new golden tee and new safari hunter as well as a few others. This would be an excellent place to watch a game.So, the experience was pretty darn good, even if it was in an obnoxious corporate atmosphere. Prices would have been a little higher than is reasonable for Chambana, but I went on a night with a deal (check their website for that). Had a talented server, and that made all the difference.

<Content> While browsing for a place to find dessert in C/U, I noticed that Old Chicago had 3.5 stars.  I blurted out, "3.5 stars? Who is writing these reviews?" Seriously, that guy above me, or that girl below, who gave this place 4 stars. They don't know what good food is. Don't listen to them. Sorry, but it's true.This place is a blaspheme of Chicago as a restaurant city. The owners should write an apology and make cash reparations to the city for besmirching its reputation and as a consolation for anyone coming into this place thinking they would be getting true Chicago food.First off, you walk in, and the obligatory Chicago street sign, for Rush Street no less, is in orange. Orange? I grew up in Chicago. Not once did I ever see an orange street sign. Black on yellow or white on green. We have orange highway hazard cones. Hmmm, strike one. Onto the menu. The restaurant was started by a bunch of guys from Boulder Colorado who had never even been to Chicago. Well, that sounds like the kind of people you want dishing up authentic Chicago food, doesn't it? The pizza combos used ingredients that no authentic Chicago pizzeria would ever be caught dead using. Pineapple? Chicken? Anaheim chilis? Oh, and then there's the lame "Chicago Seven" name to try and tie it all into Chicago. Otherwise, the pizza names resemble something you'd find at California Pizza Kitchen. And I don't mean California Avenue, where Giordano's, a REAL Chicago pizza place, was founded.  Strike two.The pizza got to the table fast. I do mean fast. When pizza gets to your table in 15 minutes or less, that means one of two things: wood burning oven, or frozen pizza warmed up in a conventional oven. I'll leave the reader to guess which choice is correct. Taste test time. I've lived on the north side and the south side. I know what the different neighborhood pizzas taste like, and what a Chicago pizza should taste like in general.This wasn't Chicago pizza. The crust was cardboard-like. Chicago isn't world-renown for its thin crust pizza. But those neighborhoods pizza places that focus on thin crust do it in a cracker-style. Not cardboard.  The mushrooms looked canned. The tomato sauce was bleh. Strike three.Oh, and just for good measure, the spinach artichoke chip seemed to be devoid of spinach, but not of salt.They do have a good beer selection. I assume this is so you are tempted into drinking enough beer so that you do not notice how bad the pizza is.Avoid. Steer clear. There is a Rosati's in C/U as of the time of this writing, and that is representative of a Chicago-style pizza. Ironically enough, Rosati's is based in Chicago, not Boulder Colorado. Old Chicago would be a good place to bring a group, if you wanted to drink, watch a game on one of the 2,382 TVs they have, and don't care about the quality of the food you are about to eat.POST-SCRIPT: about three days after getting this review, I got an email from the marketing department of the corporate parent of Old Chicago. Basically saying that they are sorry we were dissatisifed with the experience and offering a voucher for free food. This is the saddest part of the experience. It was obviously just a form letter. The folks didn't even bother to read the review to see why I was dissatisfied. Strike 4 if that is even possible. A restaurant that is non-responsive to their customer's concerns is the worst kind of restaurant.

<Content> It's a chain pizza place and the pizza would be told it dosen't belong here if it ever went to Chicago. With that being said we got the Chicago seven on thin crust it got to the table just smokin hot and your frist slice is served to you, we were happy with the pizza tons o cheese thats a good thing as far as I'm concerned, nice toppings good sauce and the crust was good, so overall the pie was good you know not great but high end chain stuff. 110 beers don't hurt anything either. The service, it just sucked no other way to put it, get the really big beer because a refill may not be in your future. This place is not cheap 3 beers cost as much as the pie. This is a might go back and if I do I'm seeing a to go thing happening.

<Content> I'm not sure why there seem to be mostly okay reviews for this place. A few days ago we stopped there for the 2nd time while in Champaign, and I thought the pizza was so good the first time that I ordered it again this time. My husband also ordered the same thing! I got an individual size thin crust cheese pizza with extra cheese and it's a great pizza. Hubby got the double mushroom swiss burger again. This thing is huge. My child got the pepperoni rolls and gives them a "9" on a scale of 1-10. The first time we were there our server was Josh, and he was fantastic. I used to be a waitress, so I always appreciate and tip good wait staff. I asked him questions about different things on the menu, and he was able to answer confidently. He refilled our drinks without being asked to. Checked on us multiple times. Just great service. Our waitress the second time wasn't so hot, but we will for sure be eating here again.

<Content> This place brought a smile to my face. We are new to Champaign, having moved here from a California metro area just 2 days ago. We stumbled up on this place when we went to the market place mall. Of course, the 110 brews was the dragging force. They really do have 110 brews there. The food, we had chicken wings, was ok. We could tell they were not freshly made, definitely microwave zapped and threw some seasoning on the top. The place was pretty packed, lots of screens with sporting events, excellent food menu. I imagine the pizzas are their popular item. The beers are very reasonably priced, the one I got was $2. They also had specials for events and $2 frozen margaritas. Good happy hour specials - 10 PM to 2 AM too!Overall, a good place for a quick drink and snack.

<Content> I only give this place one star because zero or negative stars is not an option. Me and my boyfriend came here after hearing my sister and brother in law rave it, however we were beyond disappointed. First, it took the bartender over 10 minutes to even acknowledge us and another 10 to get us our beers. When we were finally asked for refills, the wrong beers were brought to us. Please dont ask us if we want the same thing when you dont remember what kind if beer we ordered to begin with.I ordered the calzone and got a pizza, when I corrected the bartender, she assured me my CORRECT order was on its way. This time I actually did get a calzone, but it had the one ingredient I could not eat...the dreaded peppers. The bartender got her manager who informed me it was my fault because I wouldn't eat peppers...I kindly explained to her through clenched teeth, that I ordered the sausage and spinach calzone NOT one with peppers. I declined any further offers for corrections and left hungry in fear if a lugee being launched in my food. That was only my meal.My boyfriend ordered fish and chips (at a pizza place, I have no idea why). His one request was for coleslaw as a side, he never got it....even after multiple requests....big surprise. He was also looking forward to the savory vinegar described on the menu that would coat his fries...that was not present either, even after he asked again for it. To the managers credit, she did comp our meals (even though I never got one) and gave us a gift certificate for a future visit.We decided to give it another try tonight and ran into the same issues...slow service, wrong orders and being blamed when the wrong stuff is brought out. I have honestly lost respect for my sister and brother in law for recommending this place and all of the other patrons who frequent this establishment. Shame on you!

<Content> Service wasn't that great, probably just our server though. The first time I went with my family it was fine, the other night sucked. When someone wants the chicken Alfredo without the chicken and wants veggies instead, you don't charge extra for the veggies. It's called "special instructions" on the POS. Granted it only cost $0.99 for the  substitution, but it's the principal of the cost of chicken vs the cost of veggies. Also, the veggies they gave were shredded carrots and broccoli with one sliver (literally one) of red pepper. There are better ways of going about substitutions.
