<Content> Avoid this place at all costs. They were out of almost all sides, chicken was coming back from other guest raw.. run by amateursThe manager really didn't care and the counter register person was nice but unapologetic for all the issue. We got a refund and went to browns chicken where they actually wanted our business. Browns was out of coleslaw but promptly made a fresh batch.

<Content> Racist remarks at its finestBad management, waited at the window for the cashier to show up. Wait a good five minutes and was asked "what did you order?" I was offended when I heard through the window "the chinks order didn't go through.." well have a good day. Management for this company sure can't be civil like.

<Content> I am giving this 2 stars because the biscuits were good. I don't normally eat fast food and chicken at that, but I had noticed that this place was super busy all the time so I thought we would give it a go.My wife went out to get the food. She waited 25 min in line which is understandable since they where busy. We ordered for for 5 people and spent roughly $55 dollars on food which isn't all that bad. When she got home she noticed they didn't put her food in the bag everyone else's was in the bag but hers. So she tried to call 2 times to see what they could do or there policy and what not. No answer. So she drove back to the place and told them the situation.The manager said she had to bring all the food back so she could check the bags which we had eaten most of it by this point. My wife was furious and just asked for the money back on her meal and they insisted they needed to check the bags.My wife went home crammed all the food eaten in the bag and took it to the store. The manager then dumped it on the floor and sifted through it. She then refunded her meal. This was pretty much the worst experience from a fast food place we have ever had period.

<Content> I had never eaten at Popeyes, and to be honest while I like fried chicken and the like, I've had so much bad, soggy fried chicken I tend to not get too excited about it. But, once the lines had finally died down around this new location, I decided to give it a go.I've only gone at lunch time, when they are at their busiest. But I've been amazed at how good their food is. The staff is nice enough. Let's hope that keeps up! They moved customers through the drive thru pretty quickly, too.But the chicken tenders I got were just amazing. Crispy, not greasy and with just the right amount of heat. I also enjoyed their Cajun fries. I drizzled honey on them as a recommended by a friend and that was a great combo. On another visit I tried their mashed potatoes with Cajun gravy and enjoyed that as well. If there is any negative, it's that with their Cajun flavors, I would have liked things to be a bit spicier, but I realize this is fast food and they spice it up to appeal to the most people.I can't compare it with other locations, but I will say the coating on the chicken tenders (I got the spicy kind) is better than any other fried chicken joint in town from what I've had.

<Content> Food at big chains doesn't change too much but the service does. These people are not the friendliest and they don't have much patience.

<Content> According to my receipt, I ordered at 2:36. I was asked to pull forward, no problem but annoying. at 2:56 I finally went in to get my money back. One cashier told me it had only been 10 minutes not 20 so I showed her the time on the receipt. She just walked away. Another asked the manager if she could give me my money back AND the food which had apparently been sitting on the counter for who knows how long. The manager said no to the food but did, grudgingly from the look on his face, return my money. I had already told the cashier I didn't want the food anymore anyway.Bottom line, I have had their chicken at other locations and it was good. I will not be returning to this location. One cashier seemed customer oriented, one was rude after being caught in a lie, and the manager didn't even talk to me. No, I'm sorry. Nothing. He got the money, handed it to the cashier who handed it to me.With management like that, this place is doomed.

<Content> Visited Popeyes on a Sunday and luckily didn't have to wait in the amazing line of cars that has been common here. Waited about 10 minutes for my food and receieved a delicious small bag of cold limp french fries and some chicken tenders that really needed the attention of a microwave. Food was consumed within 5 minutes of receipt. All of this only cost me the low low price of $9.30.Popeyes gives us a lot to be thankful for. They give us the usual rude service and hard to understand staff that you would come to expect from a fast food restaurant in Champaign. Popeyes also brings us traffic safety issues from the eager customers parking in the middle of Bloomington road waiting for poor service and expensive fast food. Thank you Popeyes for coming back to Champaign! Hopefully they decide to open another store to provide the public with mediocre service and food!

<Content> Possibly the worst food I have ever eaten! The coleslaw was lukewarm and too creamy, the chicken was way too crispy and there was hardly any 'meat' to the chicken, and the biscuit looked like it had been swimming face-down in a pool of butter. And then the cashier didn't give me my change; I had to tell her what my total was and the amount Of change I should get. Save your money or go to KFC! I honestly don't understand the appeal of this place. Never again!

<Content> Thank you Popeyes for coming back to CU!! First off I would like to say I always enjoy Popeyes spicy chicken. My first visit was good the staff was super polite and the spicy chicken was served so hot I had to wait for it to cool to eat it. That's not something you'll see at KFC. Anyway I will be back. Welcome back Popeyes!!! Let's hope you put KFC out of business in CU.
