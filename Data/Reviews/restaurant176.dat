<Content> This is a relatively new space at Krannert Center where you can get a smooth drink, a tasty snack, and sometimes listen to music (free), sometimes participate in a discussion about a performance, and always just hang out with friends before, during, or after a show. look for their "traffic jam" series which is usually around 5pm on a weeknight and offers music from the local scene. they will usually have a local wine shop feature something interesting as well.
