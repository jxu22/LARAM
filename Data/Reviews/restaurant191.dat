<Content> Travel the world in a little shop whether it be via cheese, chocolate, spices, teas, jams, or exotic drinks. Try the bulk bins for nuts, seeds, grains and spices if you need a little of something for a recipe but you don't want to buy a huge container of it.

<Content> This place is a great retreat if you're looking for finer foods than the local campus fare. The ladies and gents at the counter are always willing to let you try a sample before you buy any of their pastries and cheese. They also make a mean baklava (with pistachios, to boot). My only critique would be that the Asian goods and foods are waaay overpriced. If you're willing to dig around a bit, there are some great Asian food stores in the area, like Am-Ko, Green Onion and Far East. Otherwise, I would definitely come here for the luxury chocolate, cookies and organic sugar substitutes. A great little international shop, known especially for its Mediterranean food and knowledgeable staff.

<Content> This review pertains strictly to the menu. The store itself is quite charming, and it does indeed have a variety of foods that are very excIting. Based on other reviews, we stopped through to pick up lunch. What an unfortunate mistake for us. The menu features fairly-priced Mediterranean foods that sounded great. We ordered the baba ganoush and falafel sandwiches and a vegetarian platter. The falafel was microwaved and lost any texture it might have had when first prepared. It had no distinguishable flavor. The baba was so smoky, that I couldn't finish the sandwich. Three bites overwhelmed my palette completely. We had already purchased the dessert and gave them a shot, because they were aesthetically very pleasing. Unfortunately, the birds nest was soft (so sad) and the date cookie was crumbled and poorly prepared. I've never thrown away so much food. Maybe we came on an off day, but based on our experience, my recommendation is to shut it down. You've got a great store, why compromise your credibility with this food?

<Content> Now this is more like it! This store is full of amazing treats. Chocolate, cheese, frozen goods- everything you want, but don't really need, but will buy anyway! The owners/staffers here are so friendly and welcoming. On my first visit here, the owner invited me to come back the next day for a cheese tasting. It was like he had known me for years. All of my dearest friends know how much I love cheese! (for a more in-depth look at my life, click the link youtu.be/GxqycijBUn0 )They don't sell fresh meat or produce here- it's not that kind of store. This is your place for specialty items- treat yo self!

<Content> Absolutely the best selection of random imported foods you'll find in the C-U area, topped off with a friendly and helpful staff. It's pricey for Champaign, but that's the nature of international foods hand-selected and accumulated just for you.Absolutely GIANT tea section, which has me in heaven every time I visit. We used to go to the tea shop downtown, but World Harvest has them so woefully beat that we don't bother anymore (which honestly makes me a bit sad, as the tea shop is an institution in my memories growing up... I suppose that's where it'll live from now on).

<Content> Great service and incredibly nice owners but the prices make my wallet weep. A few of the more common things (some curries, pastas, etc) can be found for less in the Schnuck's international aisle. For goods from countries less well represented in CU, I suck it up and shell out. Over $20/lb for basturma? Fine, fine, take all my money.

<Content> If I lived in Champaign, I would be in trouble. World Harvest is amazing. Take every single ethnic market you can find and put them all together. Add an olive bar, artisan cheeses, fresh baked breads, and all of the worldly chocolate you can handle (including kinder chocolate and Mozart balls) and you have World Harvest. They not only have spices and dry noodles, but a large selection of frozen ethnic foods, a wall of balsamic vinegars and olive (as well as other) oils, ad did I mention the chocolates?They also had a bulk nut and dried fruit selection to choose from. Jordan Almonds scare me... but I digress.The bakery items looked freshly made, and the staff was very friendly. They will let you try any of the deli, cheese, or olive selections before you purchase.

<Content> Wow...Wow... All I can say is I can't believe I didn't stop in sooner. I've been in town for 4 years and just discovered World Harvest.The owner and staff are very welcoming and helpful, which shows that they take pride in their business. There is a very extensive selection of food from all over the world, with a delicious looking deli/cheese selection as well. I was able to find an Eastern European bread that I've been looking for, a great looking frozen Indian dish, and my favorite French biscuits, all in one trip. Unlike some other places, this store is clean and well organized. I really look forward to coming back again.

<Content> I'm here just to talk about the tea. OMG the tea. As an international food store, they have brands of tea that you won't find in a typical grocery store. The have a whole aisle just of tea. Both sides! And two end caps! There were so many brands and kinds that I had to remind myself that I can definitely come back, and no need to buy all the tea. The price ranged from $4-$8 for a box of 20 bags of tea. They had bulk tea, and about 8 specific tea flavors (not brands) were on sale. Unfortunately, none of those appealed to me, but I'll check back again!The owner is so nice! He chatted me up, asked me what I was studying, if I'm new to the area. Definitely made me feel welcome.

<Content> World Harvest is a little gem of a business in Champaign. They have such a diverse and complete variety of products from around the world, including ethnic foods, teas, jams, oils, spices, seeds, nuts, sweets, confectioneries, cheeses, meats, and even beauty products, it's definitely worth a visit. The owner is friendly, and he also owns Istanbul mediterranean restaurant in Champaign at the Crossing, which is a fresh and delightful winner of a business. It seems everything he is doing, he is doing right.

<Content> This store is CU's foodie mecca and for good reason- it has everything! Primarily tailored for the needs of international students and former city-dwellers, this is the place to get everything from ghee to chevre. Only here can I indulge my desire for German Kinder chocolate, Dutch Roka cheese crispies, Middle Eastern Zaatar, and Norwegian lingonberries. They also have a good selection of local foods from nearby farms and bakeries. Prices are far more reasonable than big stores like Cost Plus World Market or similar Chicago stores. For gifts or gourmet food, this is the best place in CU!

All kinds of rices, jams, etc. I bought some Greek mountain tea that I've been wanting to try. This store should be in Chicago, or one like it. If you are driving by Champaign, this place is worth a pit stop. It's always fun to just look at food crap.

<Content> I really like the selection of unique foods that this place has. It also has some great gluten-free options. I love the variety of chocolates, beans, oils, candies, etc.However, I've bought some things here that have been disappointing to say the least. Once I bought a rice mix and then when I opened it, I was dismayed to find several dead worms and larvae in it. Yuck! I also bought a can of coconut milk and opened it and it was as thick as mud and very sour. Obviously well past its prime. That really irks me. Some of the products have been sitting on the shelves for god knows how many years. Decades possibly. They need to have a more professional attitude and throw out all the expired food.

And the cheese...mmmm...the cheese. They have an awesome selection of cheeses, all of which they're happy to let you sample. Most importantly, they have Lurpak (a popular brand of Danish butter). Mmmmmm....butter.

<Content> As I sit here finishing my very fresh schaumksse, I reflect on how awesome this store really is, and how lucky we are to have such great owners who really listen to what their patrons want!In fact, just a few months ago they did not have schaumksse (and I had not really remembered them carrying it prior to this moment). I knew this because I asked the owner. Only a few weeks later I came in and there they were! It seems that since then they have started keeping them in stock non-stop. Thus, this is the best international store in Champaign-Urbana.

They have several different kinds of henna, powdered and in tubes, ranging from poor quality to good quality. They have some cool Islamic items like tooth cleaning materials made from traditional miswak, fancy imported dates, and Arab keffiyeh scarves. They have this aromatic Lebanese soap made from olives and imported oils and tinctures I had never heard of before. It's really cool. And omg it's cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeap!

<Content> This is a really neat store to browse, and if you're looking for a specialty ingredient you'll probably find it here. However, consider other options before you actually buy something. It's almost definitely cheaper elsewhere. If you don't feel like shopping around or stopping at multiple stores to get what you need, just be aware that you're paying extra for the convenience of a one-stop-shop. Also, check expiration dates. I forgot to do so last time I shopped here, and ended up with some lovely stale food. I do like to stop here and buy a few things as an occasional indulgence, but in general it's just too expensive.Their halva is fantastic, though--seriously, the best.

<Content> I like world harvest. I go there for cheese, chocolate, pita bread, grains, jam ... that kind of stuff. And its good. They have many things you cannot find elsewhere. However, they WILL sell you rotten food. We bought goat cheese on "sale" that was 3 weeks past the sell by date. And I found worms in the rice once. Right there on the shelf with all the other foods. Kind of off-putting. I told the management and they argued that the cheese was totally fine. Um ... maybe, but 3 weeks past the date? They said, "oh yea, totally fine." Unacceptable to receive no compassion for the fact that they sold me 3 week old cheese. Update: the cheese is still on the shelf a week later. A month old. Is that even legal?Two years ago, I would have also given this a 5-star rating. Today, just 2. Just stop selling rotten foods. It's THAT easy.And don't eat the falafel sandwich either. Its soggy and gross.

<Content> I do not want Sriracha sauce. I need sriracha sauce. Also baklava, organic chocolate, gouda with basil and garlic and maybe some ginger beer. All of which World Harvest is more than prepared to sell me. They have a nice selection of the yuppie luxury items I'd expect in such a store - olive oil, mustard, chocolate, dried pasta, etc. Basically everything I'd think of as "contraband" if there was a war on. And while I can't speak for 100% of the store-made goods, I will say that the cashew baklava is mighty fine stuff. Plus, the prices on all of it seem very reasonable.I took off a star because... I'm a snob. Because I want more. I'd like a bigger cheese selection with more of a display and some fois gras. Not that kibbi isn't also excellent, but I'd like you to indulge my stuffwhitepeoplelike attitude just a tad bit more please. The store could also stand to have a couple hundred more square feet, perhaps filled with a nice wine selection. There really aren't enough places to buy a decent Malbec in this town, maybe this place could be one?All in all, an excellent establishment that I will never be able to just walk past. Surely one piece of baklava can't hurt me.

They have a great selection of olive oils, pasta, tea, jellies and jams, condiments, and candies. Saturday is cheese and olive tasting and they have a wonderful selection of both. Prices are very reasonable and the quality is high. The owner, Mohammed, is a very friendly, kind, gracious, helpful man who is a pleasure to know. I can't say enough good things about this store and its owner. Go there. Walk the aisles. Sample the cheese and olives. Stock your cart or basket with a wide array of goodies. You will become a regular just as I have.

When I asked for a special mexican dessert that I've only found in my home town, I was surprised when the owner came out and asked me if I would bring the wrapper of the dessert so that he could try to have it ordered! I was also fascinated by the variety of foods, drinks, sauces, chocolate, you-name-it. They even have a lot of organic items. I definately recommend shopping here!

<Content> They have good variety of brands and items and although they're priced fairly high, it's understandable. They do have a warm food counter, however, from what I noticed, they use a microwave to warm up the food which some don't like. Their warm food is ok but not something I would go out of my way to get. They've improved cleanliness throughout their shelves/isles which was a problem in the past especially when you take a product off of the shelves with a good amount of dust covering it. But again, that's all understandable assuming some products don't sell as frequently. I've questioned the warm food hygiene since it is located near the cash register and employees are often switching back and forth between handling cash and serving food. They've always used gloves or spatulas but those that have the knowledge are aware of reaching over uncovered food containers to rich a product placed closer to the front of the display and the fact that bacterial and etc, can easily come from an employee's skin/clothes/etc, while reaching over. The above are all justifiable based on their location/resources and other factors that limit their operations. What I don't understand is $10 minimum requirement to use Credit/Debit cards. I'm a frequent customer at this business and I look past all the faults that I stated above. However when I rush over during a few free minutes only to be turned down because of a purchase of less than $10 when I only have my debit card to pay with? That doesn't speak highly of the management/owners or the employees because what I spend at this business is well over the transaction charge. This is a small convenient store slightly larger than an average sized 7-Eleven and they sell many items that are less than the $10 requirement. Greedy? Maybe but regardless of the title any one of us chooses for their practices, the lack of competition in this area shouldn't give the owners a reason or excuse to have ignorant policies. $10 minimum? I would even let a $5 minimum slide but $10 is pushing it.Bottom line, take cash with you or don't walk in unless you're willing to spend more than $10 which I almost always do, except this one day. They may lack local competition but the internet is very close and I can most definitely purchase the same products for cheaper or the same, including the shipping charge. Not good business practices for a local business that depends on local clients.If you don't care about that, then more power to you and enjoy your shopping experience.

<Content> While I certainly appreciated the variety of ethnic food that World Harvest offers, I was very disturbed to find two small dead worms on a box of Spanish rice I was about to buy (at first I thought it was two grains of rice which made me even more disturbed). That is just not acceptable for a grocery store. If you are going there, be sure to look over all of your items before purchasing.
