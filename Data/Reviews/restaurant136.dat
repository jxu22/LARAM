<Content> I'm sorry, what's with the negative reviews?Can you say DRUNK FOOD?This place is heaven at 1-2am any night of the week, its delicious and potentially nutritious. You can tell from the outside you're not going to get the fanciest wing eating experience, but for what it is you're going to get your fill.(I suggest splitting with friends)OmNomNomBONUS: going after a night of drinking is like dinner theater:Wings + watching Red Lion chaos across the street.5 STARZ

<Content> We ordered Wingin' Out on a Friday hoping that their boneless wings were a lot better than my roommate recalled. We placed an order online for 2lbs of wings with a variety of sauces and were shortly called back due to a discrepancy with the sauces coming on the wings vs. on the side. We ended up getting all the sauces on the side which was probably not a good idea but it being almost 1am we didn't really care.Delivery was pretty quick but we also aren't very far from the store so no complaints there.We thought the boneless wings were surprisingly meaty and had a lot more substance than maybe Buffalo Wild Wings. However, due to not getting the sauces on the actual boneless wings, they did taste a bit dry, maybe that's our fault but I still didn't think they were really that good.The portion size seemed at first pretty decent but we quickly realized that at nearly $13/person after taxes, delivery fee and tip, it was certainly no bargain for the amount of food we got, especially since we weren't that impressed with what we got.My next gripe would have to be the sauces. We tried 4 different ones and I'd have to say none of them were really that impressive and tasted typical of something you could buy at a local grocery store, especially the buffalo ones. The teriyaki was OK and if I had to pick my favorite of the mediocre ones we tried I'd have to say it was the citrus chipotle, but all of the sauces were very salty and we only got 2 little cups of each except blue cheese which they gave us 4? I'm not sure what happened there..2 stars for late night + pretty speedy delivery and much more meaty boneless wings than B-dubs.I still wasn't very impressed though, sorry!

<Content> Had boneless wings, and they were underwhelming. You might as well go to Hot Wok

<Content> If Wingin Out had a mother, it would be very hard for her to say "I'm proud of you, son." But Wingin Out doesn't have a mother, because Wingin Out is the product of a back-alley abortion. If you remember eating at the old restaurant at 301 Green, congratulations! You're the only person to have eaten at Niro's Gyros without being blacked out! The apparent goal of Wingin Out is simply to not be as bad as Niro's. At first glance, Wingin Out looks like a wing joint from the streets of Kabul. But once you get inside, it's actually more like a wing joint from the streets of Baghdad. You're first blown away by the lack of anything on the walls. Seriously. There is literally nothing on the walls. Not even a menu. For items and prices, just ask the guy behind the cash register who probably has more experience selling MDMA than chicken wings. I noticed that the water is served in 8-oz plastic cups, and poured from the utility sink in the back. This gives it a nice, warm, cloudy, 'I feel like I'm in an African prison' type essence. Now brace yourself--I'm going to say something good about this place. They don't pull punches with the wing sauce. You'll be shitting battery acid before you have time to brush your teeth the next morning. But the worst thing by far: the wings are breaded. Honestly. I'm not kidding. They're fucking breaded buffalo wings. The last person who enjoyed breaded buffalo wings died from a self-inflicted gun shot wound in the bathroom of a Nevada Hooters in 1989. Breaded wings should be outlawed for public safety reasons. The guys who run Wingin Out take restauranteurism about as seriously as Joe Paterno took child abuse--"Ah, fuck it. It'll figure itself out." But there's always hope for the Wingin Out empire. Drunk college students aren't rational consumers. Shitty food seems to find a place to fester at 301 Green, and if Niro's could last for as long as it did, then anything is possible. It's like the radioactive contamination at Chernobyl--there's no way to get rid of it and it will be there forever.And it will give you cancer.

<Content> My experience began with calling in an order for pickup. I ordered 20 wings and mozzarella sticks. When I showed up, they had a 10 order of wings and the sticks. So the girl behind the counter puts in another order for 10. This results in having to wait longer and pay more for 2 orders of 10 instead of 1 of 20. This alone earned them 3 stars.The wings themselves were poor quality. They were soggy and very generic. The only redeeming quality was the fact the wings were huge.Will not be visiting again anytime soon.

<Content> A big improvement over the old Niro's Gyros. They installed their new sign on Wednesday, January 18, 2012.

<Content> Disappointing wings. I tried the boned wings in medium buffalo and citrus chipotle. The sauces were good enough, but the wings themselves had no crisp to them, just that wet, mushy layer of soaked breading that is the hallmark of bleh buffalo wings. Particularly considering the quality, prices were nothing to write home about, either. I'd prefer BDubs to this.

<Content> DO NOT ORDER WINGIN' OUT ON EAT-CU. I went to pick up my food 45 minutes after my order only to find that they had not received my order despite me having an e-mail saying they did. Not only did I have to wait even longer for my food, the cashier was rude to me and there was confusion on whether or not I was being charged twice for my food. My credit card information was taken on Eat CU, but the cashier asked me to pay again. The owner called me personally a few hours later and said that this is how they do things with Eat CU which was nice of them but it is still very confusing/sketchy for me to give out my credit card information twice for wings that some how didn't come through even though I had an e-mail saying they did.The wings were good, comparable to BW3's but the hassle of getting them is not worth it.

<Content> My husband and I like Wingin Out and have ordered delivery from them at least three times. We found out about them when they put a flier on our door. Tonight we placed an order for delivery to find out we live out of their delivery zone. No idea why they had no problems delivering in the past but I guess their policy has always been no more than 2 miles out (we are 4.5) and now they won't deliver to us. So just FYI for anyone that lives more than 2 miles away, they won't deliver to you even if they have delivered to you in the past. And it's not advertised anywhere on their website that I could find.
