<Content> It's cheap and decently fresh sushi. We are in the middle of nowhere - fish can't exactly be delivered and prepared on the same day, so don't go in expecting something fancy. Like its rating, it's A-OK sushi. Sushi Ichiban has a huge menu though, and they offer Chinese food along with a wide range of sides, appetizers, and drinks. You can even get packaged food to go if you're in a rush.I only go here when I feel a craving for sushi and want to go all out with the all-you-can-eat offer. It's $25/person and you get a menu to mark what you want. Then they bring out your order and when you're done, you can ask for another sheet to order more. The number of choices is quite large and chances are you'll find something you like. I enjoy the sweet potato roll, the Las Vegas roll, New York roll, and the Bubba Gump roll the most. They sometimes look good, but sometimes they look hastily made and are unevenly cut/fall apart. I also hate it when they cram the rolls full of veggies/rice and only a small bit of fish. The miso soup is okay though.Tip: The raw tuna they use sometimes tastes bad, so eat at your own risk. It's not worth getting something like the spicy tuna roll and having to eat it or pay the $1/piece left uneaten fine. My tuna roll had a strange, fishy taste and the color was a dull reddish-brown with a glossy sheen to it.Waiter service: almost non-existent. You get water by yourself (grab a pitcher if you have a big party), and the only service is when they bring you your sushi. There is one Caucasian waiter who is really nice and dedicated to good service. He jokes around, is totally friendly, and he works really hard. I dislike the Chinese waiter though because my boyfriend and I were eating together and he gave our order to another couple who didn't even look like us. He literally decided to give it to the first table of two he saw. After a long wait, I asked him about my bf's order because I overheard the couple picking at the rolls and saying they weren't sure if this was their order. He says, "Oh, I gave it to that table." No apology or anything. We had to reorder and wait even longer for his order to come out. They also messed up my order and out of the three rolls I ordered, they completely forgot to give me my third one. As a poor student, I guess this is the highlight of my sushi experience when I want okay sushi, but don't want to splurge.

<Content> I tried their yakisoba and as far as cheap Asian-y takeout-y noodles go, I can't believe I'm saying this, Chopstix does it better. It's edible though so whatever. Lol.

<Content> Sushi ichiban is yet another excellent stop for hungry college kids. After tasting the delicious menu in ko fusion, I had pretty high standard but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 3 roll combo for 10.99, I got the salmon roll, spicy tuna and fancy roll. All three were superb. The fish tasted fresh and the taste was authentic, not to mention it was an incredible deal for that price. I didn't get the chance to try their non sushi dishes though. I'll definitely be back for more.

<Content> Don't let the name deceive you, because this is a one-stop Asian food shop, not just for sushi, which is what I originally thought, and consequently didn't come here for four years. The menu is huge, definitely biased toward sushi and sushi rolls, but contains other things like rice porridge, teriyaki, or noodle soup. I had a sushi roll, which was, expectedly, pricey and did not fill me up, but the following time I enjoyed a very agreeable bowl of vegetable congee. I'm usually wary of places that try to cook such a huge menu of foods, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are doing a pretty ok job of it. Definitely stop by, at least once, it's worth a look.

<Content> This place is terrible. The only reason I gave this place a shot after experiencing their sloppy food is because it's so close to engineering campus.A word of caution for those who care:None of the non-sushi items are vegetarian it turns out. Before I order something, I usually make a point to double-check. When I asked about the 'vegetable teriyaki', the guy rudely said 'that's why it says vegetable'.When I received my plate after his reassurance, I noticed some meat in the dish. I took the thing back to him, and he refused to talk to me because he said 'I wasn't a customer'! What?! I lost it when he told me to get out of the line.Bottom line is that place has bad service, is extremely inhospitable, and is not suitable for vegetarians. Furthermore, after the owner had to get involved, I learned that the all sauces/broths have some chicken in them. I can understand when someone makes a mistake. I hate when people who cannot admit it when it happens and make no attempt to rectify the situation afterwards.

<Content> The Good:-The sushi itself is pretty good, not fantastic, but good. The rolls are a little sloppy, but not too bad. -The prices are fantastic, and definitely good for a college student. The Bad:-The miso soup is just not good. The tofu chunks are enormous (around 1"x1"), and the broth has very little flavor.-The service is meh, no waiter service, unless you get All You Can Eat.

<Content> Service was good. Rolls were okay. I had a cali roll, hubby had an avocado roll and my brother had a salmon roll.They all looked okay, a bit sloppy. Taste was okay.Love that there is soy sauce and sriracha on each table. I asked for a side of spicy mayo for my roll, it was good.The specials here are really good. We came for a snack around lunchtime. 3 rolls, for 10 dollars. It made a great snack.

<Content> :/ It's alright.No servers, you must order and come back to the counter to pick up your meal but staff is friendly and courteous. Establishment is clean. Water is self serve in styrofoam cups from plastic pitchers near soda fountain machines. Spicy & Hot Beef Noodle Soup:Broth was tasty and spicy as advertised. Ingredients didn't have any of the broth tastiness. Beef was a little chewy/rubbery. Veggies and noodles were fine. Miso Soup:About the size of a can of Campbell's soup.

<Content> I was really disappointed with my meal today. I didn't have great expectations after reading the reviews, but I figured it would at least satisfy my craving for sushi. Instead, I was thrown off the minute I opened the bag. Instead of sushi soy sauce, it was just plain, cheap soy sauce, which is never a good omen. If you're going to name your restaurant "Sushi... -anything-" it's probably a good idea to actually provide the right condiments. The quality of the rolls were really poor. They were sloppy, falling apart, and some were sliced paper thin, while others were so large I couldn't even eat them without making a huge mess. The smoked salmon tasted like it had been soaked in liquid smoke instead of actually smoked. It was sour, fishy, and really terrible. The roll that was supposed to have tobikio on it had maybe 3 eggs per piece, which was terribly upsetting because it was the whole reason I'd decided on the roll.The only thing I enjoyed was the mini egg roll I received. It was hot, crispy, and quite honestly, really delicious. Maybe their regular menu is better, but I will definitely not be ordering sushi from here again.

<Content> You want some average sushi? Well, here you go. For sushi, it's best to get the lunch special where you can get two sets of rolls for a reasonable price.

<Content> It's pretty cheap (we paid about $25 for 2 orders veggie tempura, 2 avocado, 1 cucumber, 1 sweet potato, and 1 vegetable roll and were totally stuffed when we were through), but it looks like their specials seem to be where the best deal is at; quality is so-so, nothing to write home about. The place would definitely benefit from some minor renovation...it has this almost kind of like "Panda Express" feel to it. I dunno, not a fan of that aspect considering it's a one-of-one as far as I know. It is what it is, but it could be nicer, hip-er even, with not a lot of effort.P.S. This is where I made my discovery that (since they are super stingy with the sweet sauce) mixing Sriracha with soy sauce is a pretty dang delicious dipping sauce for tempura. I did appreciate that they had a big bottle of hot sauce on every table.

<Content> If you are looking for high quality sushi, the kind that makes your palate sing and your cheeks soften with tenderness, this is not your sushi place. Nor is it a sushi restaurant with great variety of rolls. The quality is decent enough, the rolls large, and the meal filling. We ordered 6 different types of rolls (a lot of food -- we were not able to finish), all roughly $5-6 each, and all tasted about the same. Many of the rolls come stuffed with cream cheese. The main flavor difference between them was whether a fried ingredient was also included. Vegetables, too, added a little variation -- the asparagus offered texture. Many of the rolls promise "crab," but the cashier told me that the rolls include imitation crab meat. The seaweed salad had a tasty sesame oil dressing. It made a nice contrast as a side. Two of us shared one portion (priced around $6).The free fried eggroll, a small complementary item, that came with our rolls was not very good. It was room temperature and oily.The restaurant is clean, but extremely plain and spare.

<Content> Sushi Ichiban has delicious, fresh sushi for an unbeatable price! I always get one of the 2 or 3 roll sushi specials that come with an egg roll which are $7 for 2 rolls or $9 for 3 rolls for lunch and then $1 more at dinner time. They have the popular sushi rolls you would get in your average Japanese restaurant but a few special rolls as well. It has a sort of fast food feel to it because you order at the counter but the taste is better than any of the other sit down sushi restaurants on campus.I get the take out quite often and they are VERY quick and always do a good job of packing enough condiments. I will definitely be eating here several times a week during the school semester - it has become one of my favorite campus restaurants since it's opening.

<Content> Incompetent management, slow and unfriendly staff, less than decent sushi...worst dining experience of my life. I didn't expect much from a fast food sushi place on campus, but I certainly did not expect to be screamed at by the old manager when all I did was simply inquire about my order since I'd been waiting over an hour for TWO rolls of sushi. Rude much? Never going back again.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone if it was the last place to eat on Earth.

<Content> I've been here a few times now for the unlimited sushi deal. It's pretty easy to get your money's worth. However, like most places on campus, the sushi just isn't that good. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. There's only one roll I've had here which I didn't like, and that's not because it was poorly made or anything; I just didn't like the flavor (the Texas Scorpion, in case you're wondering). I tend to prefer fancy rolls, but most of the specialty rolls here are pretty similar, and I'd prefer some variety.I always get a ton of yellowtail when I go, though. It's pretty tasty.

<Content> Not bad, especially for lunch specials. I ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch special for under $8 and it lasted me for several meals. The chicken teriyaki itself was decent, noodles were not the best but edible, and a salad is a salad. In sum, passable food with a big portion that earns its low price.

<Content> The place is small and could use a makeover, but it isn't as drab as other places. I went there for dinner, I knew that was a bad choice when I got my receipt-- 2 rolls and a soda for $12? Oy, this better be good sushi-- and it was just okay.I got the sweet potato tempura and tuna roll. The sweet potato roll was good, though not the best I've ever tasted. I wanted more than fried tempura shrimp in rice and seaweed-- rather too simple from the others that I have tried. The tuna roll left something to be desired-- the tuna was not fresh and lacked a natural "tuna" taste I oh so love. Both of the rolls were sloppily made-- both of the rolls were uneven and had more stuffing in others. I like food to be quick, but I also value what I eat. Two more minutes wouldn't have killed me.The free egg roll that came with my meal was small and was seriously cold. Not worth eating. I have a few more days in Champaign, and rather than going there one more time, I will stick to Sushi Rock.

<Content> Got lunch from here last week. It's just okay. Nothing special, nothing bad. I had the 2 roll lunch special which was $6.99. I had the shrimp tempura roll and an eel roll, so I can't really comment on the quality of the fish, but what I had seemed to be of decent quality. Oddly the sushi combo came with an egg roll which decent as well. If I feel like eating some sushi this place would suffice without breaking the bank.

<Content> After going to Sushi Avenue, man does this place drop in my book. I already have serious qualms with that guy at the counter. And now I realize that Sushi Ichiban has the aesthetic appeal of a hospital waiting room. Unless you want a foam box full of average teriyaki, save your prime dollars for a sushi place that is worth going to... I'll give you a hint, it's on Green Street.

<Content> I love coming to sushi ichiban for their all-u-can-eat sushi special! At first, I was a bit suspect based on what others have told me and having eaten at places in chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised! They have a large variety of sushi from spider rolls to something called a spicy tuna pizza, which is a rice patty tempura with spice tuna and spicy mayo on top. They should really add to the appetizer portion of the all-u-can-eat menu though. The only thing that really irks me about this place is that they raised the prices by like $8 within a year! WHO DOES THAT!??! Thank the lord my friends have coupons so we were able to still get the deal for a decent price. Overall, the all-u-can-eat deal is good, but only if you have those coups, lol.

<Content> The best sushi place in C-U. Not exclusively because of quality, but when you factor in their great prices, it takes the cake. Their lunch specials are a fantastic price, and the best way to order is to call in and order the 3-roll special and when asked what rolls just say "whatever the chef wants to make". The chef doesn't go all cheap when you do this - he puts out his best work in appreciation of the implicit compliment. This is the only way I order any more.

<Content> It's alright. Not particularly great, it's pretty much just Sarku Japan, as you might expect. Lunch and dinner special prices are good, otherwise the prices aren't too great considering the casual atmosphere. Sushi is okay, but nothing special. Eggrolls and crab rangoon seem to be the same premade stuff you get at alot of places. The teriyaki chicken and beef are pretty decent though.

<Content> Price is nice I was able to get 6 pieces of a salmon roll for $4 (plus about .38cents tax). The rolls weren't huge (like mini logs they were about an inch and a half in length and the size of about a quarter in width/on circular ends) but they satisfied my sushi-urge/craving (they served as a light snack). So far all I have tried is the salmon rolls and they were delish! And I will be coming back for more! Also really nice staff, as well :)

When I called and asked for a refund (since I could not eat it) the manager proceeded to scream at me for twenty minutes about how it was my fault and refused to refund or substitute for me. I will NEVER eat here again.
