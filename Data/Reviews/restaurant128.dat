<Content> Horrible food quality, the place has really declined over the years in quality while the price remains the same.  The variety was limited for it being a Friday night. I was embarrassed for bringing my girlfriend to this place as her first American food experience. The food was not well stocked, I will not be coming back.

<Content> Ewwwww. My grandpa practically lives here (hello, embodying stereotype). Hometown Buffet is inherently depressing if only based upon the clientele -- it's all the town's elderly and low-income folks plus country hicks that make the drive special just for hometown. I felt inappropriately dressed, as we were heading to a Christmas party after and my jeans + heels + blouse made me feel like I was begging for attention or something (for the record, I was underdressed for the party. Can't win 'em all).Jodi is the sweetest in the world. She always takes care of my grandpa.It's not that the food is horrible, it's just that it is what it is and the ambiance doesn't help it any. We always humor him when we're in town, but if it weren't for that I wouldn't dream of stepping foot in this place.

<Content> So many error made by the cashier but the manager fixed it up quickly (without a receipt though as I would have liked). The foods were a-okay. I didn't each much. The quality didn't seem that great and there was only pineapple served as fruits (no melons, no watermelon, etc.) The salad was sparse. Other reviewers were right- foods were salty though I think mostly with seafood. Eh.Oh and I ended up with diarrhea for the next 24 hours. Some people in my group did, too. Not sure what it was in their foods that caused such indigestion.

<Content> Walked in. For one senior, three adults, and four kids they were going to charge us $75. We turned around and walked out. Plus the kid working the register was rude to my father-in-law.Mahalo, and avoid.

<Content> I will start by saying I've personally never eaten dinner here, I have however had breakfast many many many times! I'm not sure why all these reviews are so bad- the food is always hot & fresh (kitchen staff is constantly bringing out new trays of foods) and there is a great variety of breakfast foods! They also always have the salad bar & fruit/jello/cold salads bars open is tat's more your style! Although My kids aren't picky eaters but if they were this place would be an awesome option for a relaxing weekend breakfast!

<Content> I've always thought of Hometown Buffet as a glorified dorm cafeteria. Since sophomore year at Illinois, I'd make the trek out to Hometown if I felt in the mood for all-you-can eat, American style buffet.There aren't many gems in this place, but there sure are a TON of options. I've never left this place feeling like I should've ate more. I haven't really enjoyed any of the special nights, but I suppose when your'e in the mood for some food without strings attached, this is the place to go.There are other places that I prefer on most days, but I've never been disappointed by Hometown Buffet.

<Content> The only thing i liked was the waffle fries and ranch. Overpriced gutbusting dreck. I convince myself to come back every year or so and always regret it a few bites in. Cleaner than Ryans ythough.

<Content> Went here last week for the first time in years. Seems like this place is not as well maintained as it was in the past. They also now charge for drinks.

<Content> They have an Icee machine with blue, red, and coke icees, which my son loved! Good place to take a picky toddler to eat where there are lots of choices. Otherwise, I'd skip it. The food is pretty bland and although there is a good selection, not as many healthy options as I'd like to see.
