<Content> I was starving and had to grab something really quick so I ran into this Caseys. This is a really nice Casey's, either that or I have not been to a Casey's in such a long time I forgot what they are like. Years ago I used to order pizza on a regular basis from Casey's but I haven't done that in years. I picked up a slice to go with a little cup of chocolate chip cookies and a water. All for $5!! The pizza was hot and really good. The little chocolate chips cookies were excellent too.It's OK to once in while eat something totally and all around bad for you at lunch isn't it?The people working in here were super friendly too!!

<Content> I have tried the Casey's Breakfast Pizza so that you do not have to. It is wrong, and I was wrong for eating it. Non-spicy nacho cheese, shredded 'cheddar', eggs, sausage, 3 tbs of salt, and a pastry-ish dough. I love breakfast food, and I love pizza, and in the hungover state I first tried this abomination, Breakfast Pizza both seemed like both a good idea and a great idea. Few times in my life have I been so wrong. Casey's Breakfast Pizza was my Katrina.
