<Content> When my wife was in vet school we ate here every week. The general tsos tofu was amazing as was the Mai fun and mu shu. Every time we have been back to champaign in the past couple of years we made a point of going to Empire. Today we stopped by and found that the inside of the restaurant had been gutted. No dining room or kitchen. I'm not sure if they are closed forever or they are just renovating, but I will miss this place.

<Content> It's not authentic Chinese by far.. but it's cheap (~$5) and fast. Oh... and they finally accept credit cards. Yay!! They also give free soup if you eat there for lunch. Unfortunately the soup isn't too good.. you have your choice of egg drop or hot and sour. Both are not so good.. but I'd go with the egg drop if you had to choose.I like the General Tsao's chicken and chicken with garlic sauce (if you want your veggies). I usually go with a few people and we split three dishes.

<Content> I've been going to this restaurant for over 10 years, and it's always consistently delicious.I highly recommend the Hunan Pork and Pork Egg Foo Yong.No other restaurant has come close to making the Hunan Pork as good as here.The free tea is great as well!

<Content> Now that's what I call mediocre!I'm not a snob when it comes to Chinese food at all. I've experienced both unnecessarily authentic Chinese cuisine and hyper-Americanized Chinese food and I will go for something in-between every time.So this place seems like it will fit right in with that, but it doesn't. The service blows, they have a $7 minimum charge for credit/debit cards - when I told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare, I walked out.The couple of times I have eaten here I was not even mildly enthused about anything - the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor, or any particular flavor at all, it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups. The meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small- not worth the price.Don't worry, there's about 15,000 Asian restaurants on Green St - I'm sure that you'll find something...

<Content> I've only tried 2 dishes here so far but they were so sub-par it's iffy whether another chance here will be taken. Even for a cheap Chinese place the atmo leaves much to be desired. And I'm not at all fussy about that.My friend had a tofu dish that was ok. Tasted like BBQ sauce mixed with teriyake. Should've tried the dumplings myself; was all set to do so after reading reviews here. But I wasn't in the mood for meat. So...I got the veggie lo mein. It's not a difficult dish, and I've pretty much never gotten a bad version. Until here! Bland, boring, and worst of all, super greasy. It felt like oil slicks in my mouth. Arrgh. Why? It was like being served greasy coffee- one of those things that totally mystify and leave you wondering what the hell the chef was up to back there.

<Content> My previous experiences at Empire have been pretty good. This time I ordered their recommendation of 'curry chicken' and I was not a fan. It's still a good amount of food for the money. Like most chinese fast food places- if you're dining in you get free refills on your rice. There's free Tea (I have to put ice in it cause it's usually burning)One recommendation I would have is that you do not try Indian food at a Chinese Restaurant. Even Cravings (on Wright) which is usually pretty good is pretty terrible with their version of Indian food.

<Content> For me, no trip to my alma matre is complete without a visit to Empire. I doubt I can be completely objective; I love the place too much. I mean, I've watched the family's kids grow up! I recommend the General Tso's chicken. The flavor of the sauce is amazing and the consistency of the chicken excellent.Sit by the window and watch the campus walk by below... great location.

<Content> I don't usually review boring Chinese places, but well here I am.Empire is my go-to place for cheap Chinese food. The food is good enough and the price is low. I don't go here expecting a great meal, I go here when I'm hungry and want something Chinese that is good enough to make my tummy happy.

<Content> Mixed bag...but cheap. Meat quality tends to be iffy. The restaurant itself is not too fancy and they don't have a great atmosphere.. A great bonus is their "Revolution Diet" menu, which has dishes free of salt, sugar, and corn starch. When my stomach is not tolerating most other foods, I can eat these dishes, which provide both healthy veggies and protein. I probably wouldn't opt for the Revolution items if I was not sick or dieting, but they are a great option.

<Content> This place is a bit sketchy, and it's best if you speak Chinese. But they do serve congee! Which is awesome--although not the best, only place I've found in town that does it so check them out if you're feeling a bit under the weather. Otherwise, try out one of the other small Chinese places on campus for a less suspicious experience.

<Content> I used to live above Empire, so I became very well acquainted with their food. Their food is amazing, best Chinese food I've had hands down. The shrimp in their Shrimp and Broccoli dish was my favorite, most Asian restaurants give you very small low quality shrimps, but Empire's are big jumbo shrimps and are good quality.  After graduating from U of I and leaving the area, I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant like it :/

<Content> Empire is cheap, super fast, and generally satisfying. There are certain days where I start fantasizing about their pork dumplings and must have them. And they're affordable enough that I don't feel like I should hate myself afterwards. Dishes may be slightly greasy, but they're tasty as hell. Delivery is also pretty nice, although I've had trouble on occasion getting my order through clearly via the telephone.

<Content> This was definitely not my first pick when it came to Chinese restaurants, but I decided to come with some friends to try it out. I have to say that I had my doubts, but based on what we ordered, the food was actually alright. The staff was friendly and helpful and the food came out pretty quickly. We got beef hou fun, a fish dish, and a chili chicken dish. I would come back.

<Content> Every time I came to visit one of my best friends while he was in school here, we'd make a trip (or two) out to ECR for their amazing General Tso's Tofu. No other Chinese place I've ever been to has made this dish as great as ECR. The portion is always huge and I bring home leftovers. It's also inexpensive, well-lit, and the people who work here are incredibly sweet. They also offer free hot tea and water during your meal. We always found a place to sit, whether it was just the two of us or with a larger group of people. I really wish I had this place nearby, I miss it. Yummmmm.

<Content> What the heck is some of the best Chinese cuisine anywhere doing in Champaign? Seriously folks, I have been looking for the equal to their steamed dumplings EVERYWHERE (including Chicago's Chinatown) and cannot find any I like nearly as well. Their portions, as I recall, are huge for the price you're paying, and the stuff is delicious. They make other dumpling/potsticker selections look pretty pathetic by comparison in size and flavor. For those of you who go beyond the appetizers, I highly recommend their General Tso or sweet & sour. I've really got to roll back to the old alma mater and try their mu-shu as well, but truthfully I'll probably eat way more dumplings than anything else.

<Content> Stopped by Empire yesterday for some quick takeout. Pros: Friendly service, order was ready pretty quickly, meals were cheap (plenty of food for three people for 13 and change), walls were freshly painted in bright colors, napkins, sauces, forks, etc were fully-stocked and clean.Cons: Decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross. We wondered what had been living in the empty fishtank near the door. Mix of Chinese language and Champaign newspapers scattered all around the seating area, walls postered in a million different menu items. The biggest con, however? The food. My friends got sweet and sour chicken. They said it was alright. The fried rice was BRIGHT yellow - almost saffron-y in color. Unnatural. The egg roll was disappointing. I had the pork with 'string beans,' a.k.a. green beans and white rice. The pork wasn't terrible, and the beans were passable, but it was all covered in this hideous teriyaki/shoyu sauce. There was SO much MSG that I ended up with a horrible migraine later in the evening. I anticipate that any (especially cheap) Chinese food in the area will contain at least some MSG, but this was just over the top. Considering the number of good-to-amazing Chinese restaurants within a 2 mile radius of campus (Golden Harbor, Lai Lai Wok, Rainbow Garden, etc), I won't be going back to Empire.

<Content> I really love this family-owned/ran business. I've been in Champaign for several years and whenever I need my Chinese food fix, I know exactly where to go. I love the general's or Orange Chicken. I'm not a huge fan of their 'yellow-fried' rice, but it's a price I can pay for the deliciously cooked chicken and at home atmosphere I feel.

<Content> Best General Tso's chicken I have ever had, and I'm Chinese. Granted, it's not really an authentic Chinese dish, but this place makes it damn good, and it's cheap! But man, is it spicy! One of the best fast-food Chinese places I've ever eaten at. Definitely go here when you have the hankering for Chinese.

<Content> This is my favorite place to eat Chinese food on campus. Golden Harbor might have a little bit better tasting food but this is about half the price. You can't go wrong with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef. Also, I would highly recommend the Dry Chili Chicken off the Chinse menu. That dish is amazing.

<Content> In trying all the Chinese restaurants on campus, Empire was actually the last one we tried. But boy am I glad we tried it.Empire is cheap. Probably the cheapest on campus - especially for the quantity you get for your money. Each time we order delivery it lasts at least 3 meals. That said, their dishes are hit and miss. Some of the ones we have enjoyed immensely were Sweet and Sour Fish (), Fish with Garlic Sauce (), Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (). In general, the Chinese menu items (House Specialty/Szechuan) have been awesome. One time, though, we ordered the Lemon Chicken. It came in a box with lumps of fried chicken and a gelatinous yellow sauce to pour over it.

<Content> My preferred place to eat Chinese on campus. Although, I will admit that I haven't eaten at every place around town, there aren't too many great Chinese restaurants around here (this does not include buffets). Their General Tso's chicken is amazing. Giant quantities for prices a bit on the high side, but not too bad considering how much you get. Anything bigger than a small and you're guaranteed to take it home in a doggie bag tray thingy (are the trays seriously called doggie bags, too?) unless you're sharing it with someone else. I usually only order the General Tso's or Vegetable Lo Mein (my default Chinese food preferences), so I can't really say much about the rest of the menu, but I did order soup there once and they gave me it in a giant bowl, with a decent amount of noodles. It tasted okay, but not great. It can get kind of crowded in there with limited seating and the atmosphere isn't too great, but it's acceptable.

<Content> If you like really bad generic Americanized Chinese Food, this place is for you. After my first order from this place I wouldn't dare order again. I got the Double Sauteed Pork with "Fried Rice." For one, there were more vegetables than meat, which isn't always a bad thing if the vegetables are good enough to want to eat, but these vegetables were the run of the mill cabbage, bamboo shoot, water chestnut, and sliced carrot medley that they probably stick in every dish they make. Sprinkled between the overly large vegetable pieces were slim strips of pork that were barely seasoned and covered with again, the run of the mill brown gravy that they probably smother every beef or pork dish they make, the worst part of which was that it was bland and tasted vaguely of corn-starch thickened soy. And last but not least, the dish came with a choice of white or "fried" rice. I opted for the fried rice which looked and tasted almost identical to what I imagine their white rice would have tasted like except that it was tinged yellow. It looked like the stuff that comes out of a box of Uncle Ben's, except I'd pay for Uncle Ben's.I can't believe there are so many positive reviews of this place. Granted there aren't very many good 4+ star-worthy places on Green St., but I'm led to believe that most of these people have never had really good Chinese food and stick to their staples of Orange or General Tso's chicken, or some variation on fried chicken bits in a sweet sauce. If you're looking for a good place near Green St., try Evo's on Sixth south of Green or if you're willing to walk the extra six or so blocks, head over to Golden Wok on University and Fourth.Never ordering from this place again.

<Content> For very cheap and not AWFULLY bad Chinese food, the regular, cheap, two-sized (small and large) portions menu is (barely, and I mean barely) OK. However, since they've hired a new chef, they put on more pretensions now, they have some alleged "Szechuan" dishes, which are quite a bit more expensive, yet EVEN WORSE than the regular dishes. The "new chef" is worse than the traditional chefs I've seen there for years. I tried two different dishes from the more expensive menu, some beef which was edible but undermediocre, and then a whole "Szechuan bean chili whole fish" dish which was so bad and literally stinky I couldn't finish it. (I should mention I love Chinese food and I had lots of it, in lots of places.) The reason I still visit the place, rarely, is a cheapish and tasty Crispy Whole Fish, in the regular menu, which is not authentic Chinese, but which for some reason I crave every three months.The campus Chinese place to go is Lai-Lai, period. There's simply no comparison in quality, and when the ratio price/quantity/quality satisfaction is being taken into account, Lai-Lai offers by far the best deal on campus. Compared to Empire Chinese, Evo (where the chef comes out of the toilet and back into the kitchen, without washing his hands), or even Mandarin Wok, which has some OK dishes, but not equal to Lai-Lai.

<Content> oh, where to begin.... first, it took me three tries to reach anyone to place my order. then, it took them about an hour and 15 minutes to get my food out for delivery, and once that happened, it took the incompetent delivery driver another five minutes to find where i was. and to top it all off, the chicken was crappy to say the least, and the dumplings were inedible. if this review can convince even one person from making the mistake of ordering empire chinese, then i will be happy.
