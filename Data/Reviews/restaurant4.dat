<Content> This is a real Mexican market in a strip mall setting. Huge selection of Mexican canned goods, spices, and a real carnicera. If you are looking for dried Chile pods, Achiote, or canned tomatillos this is the place. The prices are reasonable- not bargain basement, but not at all where a specialty "ethnic" food store for Gringos would be.Convenient, friendly, authentic. All good.
