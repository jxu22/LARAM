<Content> I found it very hard to find good Mexican fast-food in Champaign-Urbana... then, I ran into some of the best tacos al pastor in town! These are of the small, gently fried, double-tortilla with cebolla y cilantro variety. These compare with the tacos from Los Comales in Chicago. I agree with others that the name and location are deceptive. I drove by it many times before giving it a chance.

<Content> I went here every weekend for most of the summer. We are always looking for deals and for a while (sadly no longer) they had 99 cent tacos and tamales, and I was in pregnant lady heaven.I do think 1.90 a taco is a little pricey, it's not outrageous, and we are willing to pay. Cilantro, lettuce, tomato, lime, perfect.Their enchiladas are simple and delicious.We also have enjoyed their fajitas and the beans and rice were very tasty.I did not enjoy my steak burrito, personally, it lacked veggies and was basically beans and steak. Very heavy, pretty boring.I love that they have a variety of hot sauces and they are all very fresh tasting.I am very thankful for this restaurant, it is hard to find good Mexican food in town.

<Content> The food is authentic. The atmosphere sucks. It's brightly lit and in a strip mall across the road from Menards. Tacos like they are meant to be made, fully loaded come on maize tortillas, damp and soft, with cilantro, cebollo (onions), tomatoes and lettuce, and of course, your choice of meat.Thankfully no cheese, no sauce and no sour cream are added. I suppose they would add it if you insisted, just as Biaggi's would add sauerkraut to your lasagna if you asked nicely.Tacos are $1.99 each, or a platter of 3 for $7.50 with rice and beans.Blaring Mexican music on the satellite TV for authenticity.

<Content> We have some amazing Mexican food here in the CU. I would never thought I'd say that when I moved here 7 years ago, but the restaurants continue to pop up and each one is better than the last.This place does not have waiter service, you just order up front and pick up your food five minutes later from the window. I think this makes it a great lunch spot. Additionally it has some great lunch specials, all under $7.00. The place was very clean and well kept. We had tacos- chicken and chorizo and chips and salsa. The tacos tasted authentic. They have an assortment of sauces in the cooler where you pick up your food. The spicy red sauce really gave them great flavor. I think next time I will try the green one. If you're going for tacos, get the Mexicana style with the onions and cilantro on corn tortillas and you can't go wrong. The salsa was fresh and tasty. Although the chips were not homemade, they were hot and tasty. I love all the local places like this popping up in the area and I think ti is really important to support them. Sum it up: seriously good Mexican food! Great lunch spot.

<Content> Edit: out of business, declined in quality. Try MAIZE in Campustown for the best Mexican.What I ordered: Steak Tacos - best tortillas I've found in the area- fresh, moist, pliable and flavorful. The toppings were fresh and the portions generous. Three different kinds of salsas are kept in a fridge near the pickup window- which means the owners are concerned and knowledgeable about food safety. Bonus: the restaurant was spotless- as was the bathroom- always a good sign! Edit: Returned again. This time ordering a ribeye sope and enchilada combo plate with rice and beans. The sopes are good and the rice was moist and the beans flavorful. I would pass on the enchilada, or order it with a different sauce. Everything benefits from sprinkled cilantro and a squeeze of the just sliced lime provided. I asked the woman behind the counter- the cheese is imported and unfortunately, because I'm pregnant had to pass on it. My husband said it was good- it looked like queso fresco. It looks like they use mexican "Crema"- not sour cream- also a good sign (again, imported and had to pass on it, but my husband said it was good). This is a solid taqueria- casual and cheap food. You won't find gourmet Mexican food, like mole, and it's not as good as you'll find in Chicago, but for C-U- this is as good as it gets. MUCH better than El Charro or the Dos Reales that people seem to like- for their nachos and margaritas...

<Content> My first impression of Taco Loco was, admittedly, not great. A bluesy sign on North Prospect advertising 99 cent tacos at a place with a silly name. I imagined a place with all the quality of Taco Bell with all the atmosphere of Taco John's. But don't be fooled, this is a real taqueria.Tacos are served on soft corn tortillas with onion, cilantro, lettuce and tomato with your choice of meats. The al pastor was spiced wonderfully, the lengua perfectly tender. The ribeye steak was a nice cut, but frankly a little underseasoned. To wash it down, glass bottles of Mexican Coke (mmm... cane sugar) or, of course, Jarritos.Best of all - if you dread a trip north on Prospect, the menu says they'll be offering delivery soon.

<Content> This place almost got 4 stars from me but the only thing that I couldn't get past was the environment. Don't get me wrong though, I'm all for laid-back and casual, but I kind of felt like I was eating in a tiny cafeteria or something. The only thing I will say that was cool was that my boyfriend and I were probably the only non-hispanic people in there, which tells me this place is the real deal. It was also awesome that soccer games were on each tv. It just FELT authentic.Then we got our food... pretty solid, not to mention SUPER cheap. And there were a few different and equally delicious salas available.Overall, fast, cheap, authentic, but something between the atmosphere and the other elements just left me desiring more.

<Content> I was impressed with the two times I ate here!Conveniently this spot is located close to where I stayed and where I was attending for a test prep course in the area....The first time I went here, I ordered the chicken chimichanga! YUMMY!The second time I ordered the Friday 99 cent each cheese enchilada and carne asada taco! You can always tell if the place is authentic Mexican (Spanish by that matter!) if the establishment uses WHITE cheese in their dishes! Also, the corn soft tortilla for the taco made me missed the Mexican food in L.A. iAte all last year!The only gripe is that the "HOT" sauce was not spicy at all! I mean, at first it was, but that taste went away after like 2 bites! Perhaps they should put more peppers next batch! ;)Above all, this place was definitely NOT Taco Bell (:gagging:). I was surprised to find an authentic Mexican spot in Champaign!Rock on Taco Loco!!!

<Content> Taco Loco is conveniently located near Prospect Ave where all of the general stores.Since its near all of this fancy schmancy stores, I figured it would be a sophisticated place. It's not. its your typical mexican restaurant. Simple chairs, bright decor with candy machines on the side. They even have a CD collection for you to buy. I had high expectations of the environment, but honestly, none of this really bothered me. I love simple warm restaurants with good food! Speaking of good food,Small steak taco salad-- nothing fancy with the basic toppings. The meat (unlike most meats in taco places) had FLAVOR. Si, mucho flavor, though a wee bit tough. The topping like the gucamole were also very flavorful. My biggest praise is that the taco shell itself had flavor. Its sweet and tangy but absolutely not empowering. Most places do not have a good taco shell. Would I take this over a Qdoba veggie taco salad? Im not sure, but this taco salad ranks highly with me.Tamales-- They're not the most flavorful tamales, but they sure pack in a lot of meat (thats not all dry and gross), which is GREAT. Customer service- Overall people there were nice and the service was fast! My total for the meal was around 7 dollars. Not bad at all.Overall, for a cheap mexcian meal, tthis is the place to go!

<Content> I've been a few times. The tacos are the stars, as you would expect from the name. I have tried the chicken and lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and the chorizo burrito. The chorizo burrito was pretty good, full of salty, oily ground meat. No beans inside, just meat and some veggies, so if that is how you like your burritos, you'll be happy. The tacos are the best, though. Like Mas Amigos, they are served on corn tortillas with onions, cilantro, tomato. The veggies are fresh and tasty. The chicken is not bad, a little bland, but there is hot sauce and pickled jalepenos to fix that. The lengua is the best and I recommend it even if you don't consider yourself an adventurous eater. If no one told you it was tongue, it would just seem like slightly salty, slighty fatty, tender beef. It goes perfectly with the corn tortillas and veggies and it's the way to go.I haven't tried the tortas, but I'd like to in the future.Service is usually pretty quick. Prices are reasonable, I think. Makes a good snack while doing shopping over on Prospect.

<Content> I am on the fence here. Three stars or four. I think I'll give it four stars and retract it if I go again and have a similar experience. My wife got a chalupa. I got two tacos, one chicken, one chorizo. We also got a small order of loaded nacho. My tacos were great. They tasted pretty authentic and fresh. The tortilla shells were great (This is where I want to rate it four stars) .Then there were the nachos which were too loaded. We could've split the nachos and it would've been plenty of dinner. But they were pretty run of the mill nachos (this is where I want to rate it three stars).We will be trying it again. It was lots of food for a really low cost.

<Content> First time here, after being told repeatedly by a friend to try it out. The tacos are, understandably, damn good. Also tried the chicken fajitas and nachos supremo. Huge quantities of food at good prices. Assorted Mexican TV shows playing on the TVs made for easy entertainment. It may be in a strip mall setting and super casual but the food is great.

<Content> My first experience with Taco Loco was at their location in Mahomet. The generic sounding name was a little of a put off at first, but their food didn't disappoint.  I ate their frequently when I lived in Mahomet, but I moved to Champaign over a year ago.When I heard about the Champaign location I was excited to give it a shot. I was tempted to have a torta, as that was my usual, but I decided to give the tacos a shot. I was very pleased with the quality. If your willing to make the trek out to North Prospect or just happen to be out there, it is worth a stop.

<Content> Good and cheap food. It's what I was looking for. On Friday and Saturday, it's a $1 for a taco. They were out of the ribeye, so lost a star there. The lengua was very good! They cut off the tastebuds off the tongue, very tender, too. I also got guacamole. It was a little plain, needed salt, lime juice, garlic, and onion. Oh yea, and pepper. Still, can't complain, it's all dirt cheap!

<Content> If you're up in the Meijers/Walmart area and don't want to eat at the chain restaurants, then head on over to Taco Loco (in the Menard/Slumberland area).  This place is the real deal. They have such a huge selection of Mexican fare that you can't go wrong.  I usually order three tacos and listen to the other reviewers.... order the Beef Tongue!! It is so tender that you don't even know that it's tongue. I used to hate tongue (and still hate liver) but after eating this, I'll still hate it, but I'll only eat it here.  They prep the tacos with cilantro and onion and they come out fast and hot! You can get whatever kind of salsa you like -- I usually opt for the verde.  They also have the Mexican sodas -- like Juaritas and MEXICAN COKE/PEPSI/FANTA (ie made with SUGAR and not corn syrup).  So don't get the stuff out of the soda fountain and ask for the bottled stuff in the fridge behind the counter.  They have daily specials (like .99 tacos on Tuesdays), typical combos, menudo, corn, and whatever else you can think of.  It's a really good lunch spot up in the north Prospect area! And the prices are very reasonable too -- less than $10 for a great lunch.

<Content> Taco Loco is probably my favorite restaurant in Champaign, period. It's a very unassuming place tucked in between the Regency Beauty Academy and the Armed Forces Recruiting Center, out between the mall and the North Prospect shopping area. If you are looking for greasy food smothered in orange cheese, this is not the place for you, because the food here is NOT smothered in orange cheese, nor is it greasy.As far as I know, Taco Loco is the only place in town to get sopes, which are an absolute favorite of mine. Think: a fried cornmeal cup, filled with meat, then topped with cheese and sour cream. Not the healthiest choice, but YUM. Their two-sope special is one of my regular meals here. I also love their tamales (good balance of masa and meat) and their tacos. 99 cent taco day is always worth a trip if you like cheap, tasty food. It seems like they have 99 cent tacos at least once a month. The rice and beans that come with the dinners are very good. My husband loves the salsa verde, and I usually stick with the mild because I am a wimp. Oh, and I must mention the Mexican Coca-Cola, which is made with cane sugar and is completely awesome.The people who work here are always nice, and the place is extremely clean.The only disappointment is the chips. I bought them once, and wouldn't do it again--they were kind of stale. Unlike other Mexican joints in town, you're not going to Taco Loco for the chips, so this does not affect my opinion of the place one bit.

<Content> This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food in town. It is completely worth the trip out to North Prospect to visit this taqueria. Amazing tacos, burritos, salsas, tamales, etc. They make four different kinds of salsa and they are all wonderful. My favorite is the green salsa. They have a fajita special on Friday that is great. Fajita Fridays...Chicken or steak...2 orders for $15 . They are really wonderful fajitas.This isn't a fancy place, but it is clean, the staff is friendly and the food amazing.

<Content> I was not blown away by this restaurant, but maybe I just went on a bad day. It's not the most picturesque place in the world but I don't care about atmosphere that much when I want some fast Mexican food for lunch. I did have to laugh that there's a wall border that runs around the restaurant with various kinds of hot sauce... yet no hot sauce on the tables! And you'll want hot sauce as the food itself is a bit bland. My tortilla was a bit brittle and the meat seemed under seasoned. I might check it out again some day based on the positive reviews here but sadly my first experience was not very good.

<Content> Not sure if it was an off day or what but I ordered a Carne Asada plate from here for dinner during the week and it the meat was tough and chewy. It was not seasoned well and had no flavor. The guacamole was getting brown, what can I say it was horrible. I will definitely not be returning.

<Content> Taco Loco is my favorite place to go in town for tacos. Authentic Mexican style tacos with the soft corn tortilla, onions and cilantro on top! They don't "bland down" the flavor to suit the midwestern tongue, like a lot of local Mexican restaraunts do. Very tasty and reasonably priced! The atmosphere- OK it's like a school cafeteria, so not the place to bring a date. But if you want to chow down on some tasty authentic Mexican style food this place rocks! Also they have Mexican Coke and a number of other bottles/cans of Mexican sodas available as well. And if the food puts you in the mood to listen to some tunes from south of the border they even sell CD's here. OK that's kind of weird, but still cool. Anyway- I give their tacos 5 stars, their burritos are great but could be bigger and their salsa is kind of average. But as taquieros go- great!

<Content> If you're only buying the tacos at taco loco, I'd give it 5 stars easy. It's also in a very odd location out past the mall, so you have to have it in mind and make the trek out there. It's worth it, though. They have outstanding tacos. They are very simple with no gimmicks---great tortillas, some tomato and onion, some cilantro and your choice of meat. My particular favorite is the chorizo--very good.I have to give the place 4 stars, however, because I don't think the rest of their fare matches up their tacos. So stick with the tacos here, get three, and have a great lunch or dinner.
