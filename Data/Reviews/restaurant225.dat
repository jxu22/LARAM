<Content> This place is cavernous! You can walk around in there and keep finding little niches to stand.Ample tvs for game watching and great college spirit.My niece enjoyed her "Gatorade" which looked pretty good.Despite the frigid temps, the entire place was rockin'!Solid drinking establishment!

<Content> Service was horrible from the start. We waited for an eternity just to get menus. There was even a wait after I personally had to ask them to bring us menus. The waitress said they are very busy but the place was at 40% capacity. I understand if things are going slow but the amount of time before we even got our menus was a little ridiculous.Second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time. We had a party of 6 and 4 menus came out, before the next 2. Only 4 waters came out, before the best 2. All of our burgers came out at different times. Also, between each visit from our waitress, there is a long wait.Now the food. I got the California burger with onions rings. The burger was extremely bland, you hardly notice there is guacamole, bacon or basically anything. I'd be shocked if they even seasoned their burger patty. Only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings. Today they had half off burgers, which is the only reason why anyone should try their burgers. At full price, I'd rather go to Burger King or TGIF.It's also unfortunate that their 2.00 bud light draft special was broken. I thought they'd replace the deal with something else other than can bud-a-ritas...If you really want to try this place come for half off burgers. On a Thursday. I'm thoroughly disappointed.

<Content> Classic college bar. Best thing is the 1/2 priced burgers (which they have a ton of good options of) they have 2-3 nights a week. Drinks are reasonably priced. Service Is decent. If you're not there to party with college friends or get a half off burger it's probably a good idea to find another spot in CU!

<Content> Ha, Joe's, or as I like to call it, "The House of Regrets" was oddly one of my favorite places. It probably had to do with one summer when I had a Temporary Tattoos-day party during 8th grade dance night. The dance floor is where craziness happens and I honestly haven't spent any time anywhere else in that place. But from what I remember, which isn't very much, that alone makes it worth going (but not worth cover, which btw, why did they charge cover this summer? -1 star).Last comment, lol to the review that recommended KAM'S for a "better time" than Joes. Joes might have the sticky floors, creepers, and it's fair share of d-bags, but at least it doesn't perpetually smell like vomit.

<Content> They've got some really great specials! We came on a Friday and got a pitcher of shandy for $6. Their burgers are good, especially The Mountain (with avocado), and the Bob Marley. Also, I really liked the fries!! Customer service is pretty lax, but not necessarily poor. Restrooms are clean...enough. Overall, a great experience!

<Content> The only reason I've ever been to this hell hole is because I knew someone who worked there. You can see overweight sorority girls clumsily swinging around the "poles" in the back bar while attempting to get the attention of one of the bartenders and dodge the puke on the floor.One good thing is that the drinks are RIDICULOUSLY cheap. shots are $2, pitchers can be as low as $4. I would imagine that if you went there in the afternoon you could have an enjoyable happy hour on the patio, but don't go anywhere near this place after 10.

<Content> Wow....went to campus to partake in some bar hopping while the students were gone. Hardly anyone was in the bar. We had been served by a girl with an Illini scarf and was awesome. Then....another girl took over. We ordered a diet with vodka, a Coors light and 2 Joes brew. What we received was a coke and jack and 3 Coors light. THEN....the bartender gave us the new vodka and diet and walked away without giving us any beers. Amateur at best.

<Content> Joe's. Meh.There's always a cover here (sometimes going up to as much as they charge for nightclubs up in Chicago! Wtf?), the line's always hella long, the floor's always really sticky/crunchy, the crowd's always really trashy/slutty (what can you expect with stripper poles on a stage by the dance floor?), the drinks are overpriced, and the place is always super packed. So really, if this is what you're into, then you'd probably love it here, but it's just not for me.The crowd you find that frequents Joe's consists of a lot of scantily clad sorority girls and collar popping frat guys. If you can manage to maneuver your way through the sea of bodies in the hella hot and humid place and manage to secure a pool table, it can be alright with some friends and a beer. They do have heating lamps and an outdoor area for if you need some fresh air from the stifling bar, but all in all, I would say Joe's is my least favorite bar on campus.

<Content> I only know enough about Joe's to know that the burgers are delicious, and that they're half off on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. I almost always get the Loaded Potato burger, which is great, and their fries are amazing. Occasionally the service is really, really slow, which is a real pain in the neck, but it's not a regular problem. Their drink specials are also pretty good, on par with the rest of Campustown. As long as you treat Joe's like a den of vampires (avoid after dark), it's a nice restaurant.

<Content> Joe's Brewery is your average looking bar in Champaign. On Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, Burgers are $5 dollars. I got the Gold Rush Chicken burger, which I thought tasted pretty good. The chicken was well done and was seasoned properly. The meal also includes a side of your choice. The only reason why it deserves 3 Stars was because the wait time was ridiculous. We waited close to one hour to be seated, and then an additional 30 min waiting for service. However, we were compensated by receiving an additional side for our meal. In the future, I recommend getting carry out and avoid the hassle of dining in.

<Content> Ew. Sticky floors, poor service and always a grimy guy outside waiting to verbally assault you. No thank you. My friends came here to get burgers so I waited outside with them. The waitress, I know not her name, was incredibly RUDE and inattentive. She spent nearly 1 hour and 45 minutes flirting with a table of guys right in front of us, without checking up on our table. Hello, rude waitress. Nobody tipped, and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us. We had to hound her to even pay for the meals. What a horrible waitress. She really should be fired. Both our table and another table of girls never got served until the kitchen almost closed. Yikes...they really need to improve their service.

<Content> The floor is sticky, packed tight that you can't access either the bar or the bathroom if you wanted. Decent number of options on tap however, and it's leagues above Kam's. However it's a lot trashier in quality than Brother's. At least it has an outdoor section for the nicer times of the year which is a huge relief when you want to get out of the sweaty inane madness that is Joe's.

<Content> While this place is full of the scum of the Earth, I still have fond memories of this place. You always leave there with a great story, even if you had a miserable time. There is a good chance you are going to stumble out of there around 2AM covered in sweat and vomit, and it might not even be yours! Some of my best and worst college experiences come out of this place and even though I graduated this past May and have all of Chicago at my disposal, I still sometimes wish I could wait in line for a half hour for the opportunity to get mediocre well drinks and my dance on.

<Content> I miss this place; but only for early afternoon time on thursdays when you get fabulous service from the barkeep: frosted pint glasses and .10 most-delicious-cram-as-many-as-you-can-into-your-fat-mouth cent wings?! it's hit or miss when you go at night though; they do have a decent beer selection and $2 u-call its but I'm over the disgusting floors of Green St bars, random ass grabbing, and getting spilled on. Come here for happy hour and you're set. Come here for happy hour on a thursday and you're treated like royalty. If it weren't for that alone I wouldn't come back.

<Content> Hey girls- this review is written for you. I went to Joe's today, and when I left the bathroom there were two guys in it. Now I know us girls like our privacy, and we ESPECIALLY don't want any guys listening or watching us in the bathroom. The employees were incredibly rude and were just standing in the ladies room. I felt extremely violated of my privacy (as any girl would) and when I confronted the employees they kicked me out. This is not ANY way a girl should be treated, especially when creepy employees lurk around the bathroom listening to girls do their business. Wouldn't recommend this bar- stick with Cly's or KAM's for a better campus experience.

<Content> Joe's almost always has cover, no matter what time of night, but it's definitely worth it. The front area has pool tables, booths, tables, a large bar, and bathrooms. Ladies, be ready to wait in line (or sneak in the boy's room when no one is in there like I did)! The back room has the dance floor, a stage with stripper poles (this can get slightly scandalous) and a bar. A very eclectic mix of people, I remember my friends nick naming it the UN convention, because all different types of people come together. Decent specials, but one of the more expensive bars on campus.

<Content> First off, the people that run this place, such as the bouncers are complete assholes. Aside from that, the drinks are really weak and the area is just too crowded to even move. There are a ton of creepers on the dance floor and quite a few nefarious characters. It's not worth it.

<Content> Maybe I am missing what the big draw to Joe's is but I feel like C-U and Campustown have better bars around town. Being a grad student, I think the appeal is usually lost. The only plus is that they have my favorite cider (Strongbow) on tap. The service is okay and I am glad that they at least have their own beer. Their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay. Given the choice, I would choose other bars over Joe's.

<Content> Great burger selection but the execution was a little weak for my California Burger (fried egg, guacamole, BLT, cheese on 1/3lb burger).  The fried egg tasted like a boiled egg and I couldn't tell there was guacamole on the burger but it was okay. They have two full pages of burgers so I'd be willing to try them again. It's 1/2 price burgers on Tuesday nights so my meal was less than $5 so I gave them three stars for my first visit.

<Content> Half price burgers on Saturdays - which also applies to the veggie and chicken versions (but not the 3/4 pound beef ones) - are a great idea. For traditional patties, you have to choose a 1/4 or 1/2 pound burger. The Mac & cheese isn't necessarily worth the $1 upgrade, so don't bother - unless you want to pay for boxed mac&cheese that has some bacon bits tossed on top. They have a good selection of beers and sodas (be aware that it's not Pepsi *or* Coke products but RC/Dr. Pepper). I thought the draft of Bell's two-hearted complemented my Urbana veggie burger quite nicely. If they'd offered ice cream for dessert, it would have been true love. Also, note that it was very crowded (and noisy) indoors but that they have an extensive patio. There was an upstairs space as well, but they apparently only open that for table service *some* of the time.
