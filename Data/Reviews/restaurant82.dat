<Content> This opened up in place of El Toro. I liked it SOOOOO much more. The tortilla chips were tastier. Salsa was much better. The manager himself brought out this super-awesome hot salsa. None of the crappy smoky / fake-hot salsa. I ordered the Burrito Ranchero (all scrambled eggs). Came with rice and beans. Loved it. I went with two friends and we all concurred that it was much better than El Toro. Check it out.Edit: I dunno what happened to this place. When I'd gone at 3pm it was mostly empty and I got great service. But then when I went during lunch hour (12-1) it was horrendous :( They really need to get their act together

<Content> Back in my college days, El Toro was my go to Tex-Mex restaurant. Since graduating and moving back to Chicago, I have had always a hankering for some El Toro. So luckily I was in town for an event one weekend only to find Fiesta Ranchero. I was apprehensive about eating here and thought "maybe they just went out of business, but still have the same cooking staff." When the waiter came, I asked "What happened to El Toro?" With a puzzled looked the waiter feigned ignorance and asked "What's El Toro?" When he left, the woman in the booth next to mine leaned over and whispered that it had moved down the street! This greatly annoyed me, but considering I was feeling hungry and adventurous. I decided to give this chain from Bloomington a chance.I ordered Veggie fajitas (what I always get at El Toro) and it was absolutely bland! On the way out as I paid the manager/owner? I asked again the money question: So what happened to El Toro? I ASSUMED at least I would get a straight and honest answer from the management, but to my amazement he said he wasn't sure and that they closed this store..UGHHH! I understand you don't want to lose business to competition, but lying to your customers is downright rude and unacceptable in the restaurant business.Go back to Bloomington! On second thought, they don't deserve bad service either.

<Content> As others have said, steer clear of this place. My friend and went there for dinner, walked in the door at 6pm on a Saturday night and the place was completely empty (first warning sign). The staff is ambivalent at best. our waitress took our order for a Fiesta Burrito and a Fajita quesadilla. And against our better judgment we decided to order a pitcher of margaritas (since it was only $15). We had one question for our waitress, how big the pitcher (like in how many ounces)? Her response? "Look in here, it should say" while she hands me back the menu. To which I responded to her that the menu did not in fact list the size of the pitcher. Her next response was that it was "normal" size and walked away. Our food came out 5 minutes after we ordered it, getting to the point of being "too fast" in my book (making me wonder how it was prepared, microwave?) As the food was set down our waitress mentioned that the "plates were hot" (mind you she is wearing huge silver oven gloves). I will tell you this, she wasn't lying, these plates were scorching hot, as in I could not even touch it to move it on the table. The food was at best mediocre. My burrito was filled with greasy pork and covered in bland rachero sauce. My friends fajita quesadilla was passable (though quite small).Finally the pitcher of Margaritas showed up. I will say I typically do not have very high expectations for "house" margaritas, I'm expecting inexpensive tequila, but these margaritas didn't even meet those low standards. They were neon green and tasted of pure sweet and sour mix, not a whiff of tequila was detectable in smell or taste. My friend and I finished half a glass each of the concoction before we decided we could stomach no more. Our waitress took 20 minutes to come back and check on us . Upon learning that we were not satisfied with the margaritas she responded that she would have to speak to the manager. She returned a few minutes later and said that she was sorry but that we would have to speak to the manager our selves when we went to pay (which you do up front). Fine, so we go up to pay. We get to the front cash register and there is no one there. We wait 3 or 4 minutes, still no one there. We finally decide to look in the bar area and find the host sitting a table watching TV. We point out to him that we want to pay, so he gets up to go man the cash register. When we explained that we were not happy with that margaritas, he says he'll go get the manager. Finally the manger comes out, we explain (in an extremely polite way) that we were simply not happy with the margaritas. He thinks for a minute and tells us that he will give us half off the pitcher (mind you, we consumed less than 1 glass total from the pitcher). At that point I was beyond arguing and just wanted to get out of the restaurant, so we paid and left.  A word of advice, take your money elsewhere.

<Content> When I go out for Mexican, I expect flavor. That being said, Fiesta Ranchero was not what I expected. Maybe my first mistake was ordering the Speedy Gonzalez combo, which was a couple tacos and an enchilada (or something like that). Or maybe it wasn't my fault. Everything on the plate, including the rice and beans, was pretty underwhelming.I probably won't go back while there are still better Mexican places near campus (El Charro, Cocina Real, Fiesta Cafe).I'll give this place two stars because the service and the chips and salsa were good. Also, it was fairly priced.

<Content> The food is flavorful with large portions at a very reasonable price. The condition of the restaurant is what keeps me from adding a fourth star. The interior is run down and the carpeting filthy. Wait staff is helpful and courteous . . . when you can find them. More often than not it's the manager that waits on us.
