<Content> I feel like for a Red Lobster this place is great. Service is excellent, food is decent, and the place itself is pretty nice (I'm surprised they remodeled recently). Considering the price it's a top rating for me as the service is excellent and the food is good enough.

<Content> My fiance usually needs at least one or two trips a year to Red Lobster, to fulfill the Korean side of him that craves seafood. I personally find the atmosphere and food to be vulgar, but how can I say no to someone who NEEDS seafood?!I usually get the half portion of salmon with a garden salad, rice palaf and vegetables. It tastes exactly like I think it's going to: bland salmon flavor with lettuce, salty rice and salty vegetables. Blech.

<Content> After sampling many chain restaurants, I know that not all chains are created equally, even if they operate under the same name. I've stopped by Red Lobster restaurants in other towns and have been overwhelmed by delightful, positive experiences, so I thought I'd give the local one a try.When I went on a weekend night packed with other customers, I was concerned about wait time but fortunately my party was seated almost immediately. With so many patrons vying for the attention of their servers, we were overlooked and felt we got the cold shoulder because of our age (a young college group). The interior is old and ragged, which conveniently fits the "shipwreck" theme. We were pushed into a dark corner (intended to be "romantic lighting," I think), but I could still make out the wear on our seats and the carpet.For dinner, I ordered one of their "daily catches" and had it cooked on the grill. The fish was bland, unmemorable, and did not justify the cost; the only flavor came from the lemon that I judiciously squeezed on top. As for my side dish, I was horrified by my broccoli. It had been cooked beyond redemption, with each bud shriveled and blackened. The saving grace of the meal was the biscuits (crunchy outside, hot and buttery inside), which have been consistently good between all of the Red Lobsters I have visited.At the end of the meal, the bill for my boyfriend and I came out to about $40 (including tip). Not a happy customer.

<Content> Blech.I'm always skeptical of a seafood place that has an overwhelming fishy smell as it tells me the seafood isn't that fresh. Red Lobster has that smell.

<Content> We went to RL for lunch today. They still have the shrimp tacos that I raved about but this time I tried one of the lunch catches. I just want to send a shout out about the portion sizes. I ordered the wood grilled shrimp and chicken. The chicken breast was about the size of a chicken tender - very thin and small. The shrimp and potato were small too. The potato was about the size of my fist and the shrimps about an inch big. The flavor was wonderful. Everything tasted really good and although it sounds like I am complaining about the size I am really not because that was all I needed to eat for lunch anyway. I just wanted others to know the scaled down size so they don't leave hungry. It was only 8.79 so the price is scaled down as well.

<Content> For the price I paid the food portions were more than adequate. I left with a to-go box filled with leftovers.We were seated immediately, but unfortunately we were put into the same corner of the restaurant as everyone else and had 3 very unhappy young children sitting near us, one of which was having a birthday party. I suppose this could be because we went later in the evening when they were trying to clean up the other part of the restaurant.The service was agreeable, our waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and was prompt on drink refills. We did have to ask for some delicious Cheddar Biscuits though.The quality of the food was acceptable, but for the price I paid I would've expected better. Then again trying to get "good" seafood in central Illinois is a bit of a joke.All aspects considered: it was an enjoyable evening out with friends, and I left satisfied.

<Content> Pretty darn good! It wasn't a busy night. It also helped that we didn't arrive until after 830pm this evening.More than 3 decades ago, I worked in the 1st Red Lobster of Champaign as part of the opening crew until about 18 months later. At Red Lobster I learned to cook all manner of food. Other than their grilled food, I imagine the food is prepared and cooked the same way as in times past.That being said, I am not a fan of seafood (unless grilled outdoors) and generally defer to a nice steak and baked potato. My guest will most always choose the seafood side of the menu.I had a good NY Strip steak. She had a "Festival of Shrimp". The shrimp was reported to be completely delicious. The steak was... OK. A couple of times I've had to send back steaks that are overcooked or tough. This time wasn't one of those times. It was cooked to medium doneness properly with a warm pink center. Good food. Certainly not the least expensive. Which is probably why Red Lobster is only visited about once every 3 months. Had it been maybe $10 less expensive, it might have earned 5 stars.

<Content> Red Lobsters around the country have gone through a recent renovation of both their decor and their menus that you may have missed. The move has made the restaurant into more of an upscale offering, with concordant higher prices. It is the act of offering that is now more upscale, however, and not necessarily what is offered to you.The change results in an additional menu section where you can choose any of a selection of fresh fish and then choose how you want it cooked (oven, pan or broil). Then you get a couple of their standard sides for $13-20. The rest of the menu, other than the big crustaceans, is cheaper than this. Its not a bad deal if the fish is good and fresh and then cooked skillfully. In my limited recent experience, (one recent trip to this location and two recent trips to other Red Lobsters) their cooking is hit or miss. I was very happy with my broiled salmon in terms of size, flavor and doneness. Others have been less enthusiastic, with classic fish complaints (size/strong smell/consistency). Don't worry, they still have their stupendous cheddar biscuits and the coconut fried shrimp with rum sauce that are even better. These shrimp are so good, I think of them as the crab rangoons of the Red Lobster and get them every time.The rest is pretty much the same, but with slightly different (less?) stuff on the walls and probably higher prices than you may remember. They have a decent variety of beers and booze and a chain restaurant's expected bevy of froofy drinks. But is it worth it? If you go for one of the shrimp or lobster fests, or you have a coupon or gift card to soften the blow, its definitely worth it. I am a pretty frugal guy, and even though I love fish, there are many places I would rather spend this kind of money at, like Yellowfin. If somebody spruces up Seaboat into a nice take a date joint though, its over.

<Content> This review is purely for the service. Red Lobster food is Red Lobster food, and you're going to get subpar seafood pretty much no matter what. You're in the midwest...what do you expect? The service here is fantastic. My salad had something funky going on with the lettuce, and the waitress handled the situation beautifully. She apologized, and promptly offered me a new salad, and went to get the manager. I declined the salad (eh.), but the manager was very sweet, and took my meal off the bill. Additionally, my boyfriend wanted dessert, and they paid for that too! Despite the fact that it was a small mistake and not their fault, they dealt with the situation by putting the customer first. We will be back because of that great response...and maybe the cheddar bay biscuits.

<Content> Hmmm, I cannot say the food is bad but...the service is really unsatisfying. They arrange the seat closest to the restroom for us. I don't know if this is because we are Asian. Maybe I'm too sensitive...Anyway, I'm not a fan of either shrimp or lobster. So I won't come here again unless I have to.

<Content> I remember the good ole days of going to Red Lobster when I was a kid. I have to say that all Red Lobster locations have been lackluster since then. But the last time I visited this location, my experience was amazing. The service was impeccable (I even asked to talk to the manager so that I could praise our waiter) and the food was as good as I remember it being when I was a kid. I ordered the salmon and steak. the cheddar bay biscuits were utterly amazing- our waiter gave us extra to take home with us. I was really impressed with our visit. You may not be able to park right next to the restaurant, but there is plenty of parking in the shopping center.

<Content> If you're anything like me, you'll get sea-food-crave once in a while. And if you're stuck in a middle of nowhere town like Urbana, you only have one choice then. And it's here. (Unless you wanna go to the hooters. But you don't go there for the sea-food, do you?!)The food is good. Not new England or even San Francisco-sea food good, but fine nonetheless. And if you really crave for a LOT of sea food and don't have pockets full of gold, then you may still be in luck, as they have an all-you-can-east-shrimp special, with 5~7 different choices of shrimp meals that keep coming and coming ....Good place, on the expensive side though for Urbana/Champaign, and that's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star. But still on the top of my list whenever I want to treat myself, and highly recommended.

<Content> My foodie daughter thinks chain restaurants are beneath her, but now and then my son-in-law and I prevail upon her to eat at Red Lobster. They have the best Bloody Marys in the world (get a Virgin Mary if you don't drink.) The salads are good but would benefit from some greens other than iceberg lettuce. The blue cheese dressing is divine. I also love,love, love those Cheddar Bay biscuits. I usually get the salmon and a baked potato, and they also serve a side of broccoli, so it's all fairly nutritious. Servers are usually attentive and always friendly. It gets a little crowded and loud in there for my tastes, and the parking lot is usually jammed full. Sometimes I like to sneak in there alone in mid-afternoon on a weekday when there's not so many people around.

<Content> I wanted to go to Red Lobster for awhile, because I thought that, if nowhere else, I could get some quality seafood there. I was very disappointed with the food I ate. My wife and I ordered some of the more expensive dishes from the menu, and all seafood came either heavily breaded and deep-fried or drenched in cooking oil. Fish and shellfish have very delicate flavors, and they were totally destroyed by the cooks. I couldn't taste anything behind the oil; it all tasted like French fries. Given that this is one of the priciest restaurants in town in its class, it's definitely wasn't worth my money. I'm not going back.

<Content> Went to a Red Lobster in Orland Park recently and had a good expperience. Other than the long wait, which was understandable for dinner on a Saturday night, the service was good. The waiter got my order wrong but actually brought what I had in mind as a second choice. So, no big deal. The manager came and apologized profusely, comping my meal and then giving me several $5 gift certificates for the next visit. Well, my next visit was right here in Champaign. The staff was friendly and my server was sweet and helpful. I splurged on lunch, getting the Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms for starters and the Lobsterfest Special that was lobster tails, shrimp, mussels, and scallops over linguine. Other than the fact that one of the mussels was not open, the food was good. No, I didn't eat it all there. Had to get a take home box. Then there are the biscuits. Yum. Always loved them. When my kids were little and we went to Red Lobster, I would tell them to always say yes to more biscuits. In those days, they kept refilling the little basket. My kids (now adults) still remember that. So, in all, this was a nice experience. The seafood doesn't compare to the ultra-fresh stuff I ate back at Sheepshead Bay in my Brooklyn days (the fishing boats were literally across the street from the restaurants). Places like Lundy's, Randazzo's, and Joe's Clam Bar were beyond words.
