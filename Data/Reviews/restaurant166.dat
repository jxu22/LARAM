<Content> If I die young, bury me in queso.Queso from Burrito King (or Torticas, or the Burrito King truck...) will easily be the most delicious queso you have ever had in your entire life. The queso dreams are made of. The queso that makes the world go round. The queso that Burrito King smothers on everything...I love this place. Fantastic staff, good chips and salsa, big portion sizes, veggie options. And did I mention the queso? Whether it's 2 pm or 2 am, this is the place to be. And if it happens to be sometime in between 2 and 2, they have a bunch of different flavors of margaritas, but they are a little pricey. Tip for the wise (or drunk, or reaaaaally hungry): if it's one of those nights that everybody has the same great idea as you and the restaurant is packed, order your food to-go! They'll even let you snack on chips while you wait - the best.Another thing to note: The Burrito King truck only accepts cash. Don't get mad, don't cry about it, the restaurant is literally a block away. Seriously, don't cry about. Seriously.Five stars 'cause I'm in love.

<Content> Not as good as I had hoped! I should have known because there was nobody in the place at dinner time.I walked in and wanted to order carry out and was handed a menu. I ordered a Carne Milanese but was informed that they were out of that. I opted instead for the carne asada entre.Waiting for my order I noticed a couple things. First, that the inside of the place is dirty, old and not somewhere I'd want to sit down and eat at. Second, that Burrito King and Tortica's Grill are synonymous. The menu said Burrito King but the outside sign says Tortica's. My entre came with a whole bunch of stuff including the carne asada, rice, beans, 3 tortillas, pico de gallo with lettuce and guacamole and also chips and salsa.Unfortunately, I didn't think any of this stuff was very good. The beans were just OK and the rice, guacamole, chips and salsa were all sub-par. The carne asada was pretty awful. It was two very thin pieces of tough, flavorless meat that I was seriously questioning if it was actually steak. I had to put my own hot sauce on to make it bearable.I paid $11 for all this and was not satisfied with what I got. The portion size is good, but who wants a large amount of crappy food?Not this guy, 1/5.

<Content> Did not care for this place. in their defense, only tried the guacapeno guacamole but it was kind of runny and half of the container was jalapeo peppers- I thought they would be sliced up in it but still good nacho style. if I wanted guac again I would go to maize. comparable prices but much better taste

<Content> Alright, so they serve portentous portions at diner prices; but the place is absolutely dirty. The service is sub-par as most of the tables aren't clean by the time you get there.

<Content> I'm not sure why i haven't heard about this campustown gem earlier, but i am VERY happy i know about it now. First off,i LOVE their salsa more than anywhere else in town, but it must be mixed with the hot (red, not green) and regular salsa in a bowl, their fresh, hot chips go perfectly. SO GOOD.i've had the Pollo Quesadilla twice and love the flavor, especially of the Cheese sauce.Overall, this place is excellent, good service, has a big menu and best of all, its Cheap!Go here soon!!

<Content> More authentic than Chipotle for sure but thats not always a good thing. Pretty greasy overall and nothing seems to really stand out. Priced well. Service is hit or miss. Not bad drunk food.

<Content> Avoid this place. As much as you can.The chips were stale, and the salsa was bland. Although the portions were decent compared to the price, the quality of the food was poor. I ordered the mushroom quesadilla, and it was SWIMMING in oil. I was literally draining my plate every 2-3 bites to get all the excess oil off. There was also WAY too much cheese in the food. If you love mexican cheese, you might like this, but it was too greasy and too bland. My friend ordered the burrito with steak in it, and the steak was over-cooked.Next time you want a mexican fix, go to El Toro or Maize. Those dishes will hook.you.up.
