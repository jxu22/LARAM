<Content> Restaurant reviewIt is a pretty good burger is how I would like to sum up my experience. This is not your mcd or burger king. It is on the pricier side with burgers from 6-7 dollars depending on what you get. The food is cooked fresh off the grill. My major problem is the hamburger bun was served ice-cold. I don't know if this is normally the case but with the heat and cold you can see in my picture that it became soggy from condensation and deformed. Still I would say this is a pretty good burger, not steak house variety, but better than culvers. The fries are fried in peanut oil and were simply delicious. Also they are hand cut and even have a sign showing which farm they came from. All and all if the buns were warm and not from the fridge this would have been a 5 star experience.Pro: fresh burgers, hand cut friesCons: on the more expensive side, cold burger bunHidden gem:Free shelled peanuts when you walk in!

<Content> I enjoy the food at this location.Yes, it is loud and a little pricey but you get VERY large portions.The food served to me has always been served hot.Free peanuts! After years of cheap burger joints in the area it's nice to have an alternative.I'll pay a little more once in awhile to get a REAL burger.

<Content> Like any other five guys this restaurant boast a terrible parking lot where it is almost impossible to park because of the neighboring chipotle. The service was good and the food came out fast.

<Content> JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE! It took FOREVER to get our food. The music is way too loud. You can't even have a conversation with a person that is sitting right across from you. Their food was okay but I have had a lot better at burger king even. Overall my experience was terrible. I do not recommend 5 guys.
