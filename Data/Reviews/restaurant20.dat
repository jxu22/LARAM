<Content> Station 6 pizza has a sort of legacy to live up to- having taken the place of Zelma's pizza. I am pleased to say that it more than matches it. The lunch buffet is very well managed, keeping stocked and having a regular fresh rotation of tasty basic and specialty pizzas. The staff seen friendly but most of my experience with Station 6 was the buffet so they weren't particularly involved, and I personally had no interest in the salad bar so that is not a factor in my review.

<Content> Ordered a margarita pizza and chicken tenders for my boy. Pizza was a tad greasy and the chicken tenders were a little on the crispier side. The buffet looked a little iffy as it may have been sitting out. I liked that the pizza had a thin crust and had the right amount of seasoning. The woman behind the counter could have been a little bit nicer. This was my first time there with a 1 1/2 year old. She looked preoccupied with a ton of receipts spread all over the counter. She barked at me because i didnt spit out the type of pizza that i wanted. You bark at me and I'll bark right back.Minused a star for service. Most definitely will be back for the pizza.

<Content> Well.. Where do I begin!?Last week my boyfriend and I came in to eat in and our waitress mumbled the whole time.. Took our appetizer order.. Didn't offer is water with our beer.. Sooo we waited 20 minutes and still no Bosco Sticks.. The table that came in AFTER us however got theirs before us.. So as I watch our appetizers come out and sit under the heat lamp the waitress ignored us.. Then our pizza joined our appetizer under the lamps. We got the Bosco Sticks with cold pizza sauce. Less than 5 minutes later we got our pizza and no offer for refills. We never did see our waitress still she brought our check.Now.. Icing on the cake- tonight.. We order pizza online.. Two pizzas one plain cheese one supreme. It said 25 minutes. We went in and stood in like for 20 minutes and the girl took our money but no food. We keep waiting. More people kept piling in. Still no food. Were up to 35 minutes waiting when someone guy comes out and says THEY RAN OUT OF DOUGH! So we kept standing there and THREE people took our name looking for our food and them someone offers to make it.. Thought you ran out of dough?! Lets then mention the mean faced unfriendly hostess stood at the register and talked to nobody and didn't help us. All those people in there and nobody was helping or offering comped meals or anything. I then demanded the owners name TWICE and was lied to about his name. We then took our money and went to a chain pizza place had friendly quick service and 2 hours later have eaten. Who doesn't make enough dough as a fricken pizza place when you're offering large pizzas for under $10 as a special when the students are back in town with their families!? Why was nobody taking names and offering coupons or their meals free!? Word will continue to be spread about Station 6 and their terrible service. Their prices aren't bad and their food isn't bad but what the heck does that matter?! Pretty sure Papa Johns and Dominos would do a better job than this place.I will rant about this to everyone. Will rant on Facebook and Twitter. There's just no no way! STAY AWAY FROM STATION 6! Their rude stuck up unfriendly faced hostess will ignore you.. Your waitress will ignore you.. Your food (if they have dough) will take forever and be mediocre. You'll leave wishing you went to Pizza Hut.

<Content> We had the thin chicken parm pizza and salad bar. Fresh ingredients and very good crust made for a great dining experience. The salad bar was adequate and the service was quick and friendly. The Diet Mountain Dew had an off taste and we know that isn't because of the great Champaign water. What gives? Also they ran or of thick crust by 7:15 on a Friday night. Either they had a very busy day or someone isn't planning well. All in all a good experience, though.

<Content> The first time I had their pizza it was way too sweet and I did not like it. Then I found out that they have other sauces to choose from so I tried it with the traditional sauce. All in all it was not too bad. It still has some sweet to it. The ingredients were very good and fresh. It is cheaper than most pizza places in town. I reheated a couple of slices just to see how they reheat and they were OK.

<Content> Pizza was under cooked, got ignored by our waitress who we could see standing outside talking on her phone, and the Parmesan container on our table was full of blue and green moldy cheese. Won't be back.

<Content> The salad bar here was great, fresh and had stuff for kids. The lunch pizza Buffett also had lots of variety and was delicious! But better then the food was the customer service. We arrived as the lunch buffet was just closing and they let us enjoy it anyway. I will definitely be a repeat customer here.

<Content> This is one of our families favorite pizza places in Champaign. Most Gluten -Free options aren't that great this one is spot on. The bread sticks are great and sauces as well. Also the buffet is affordable and tasty! The best part is dessert for us the giant cookie with ice cream comes out in a hot cast iron skillet! Yum!

<Content> Great lunch buffet. So much good pizza. Tons of options!! I had the Hawaiian, cheeseburger, all meat, and chicken bacon ranch pizzas. The dessert pizza with chocolate chips on it tasted just like a chocolate chip cookie! Sooo good!

<Content> Came for pizza lunch buffet. Super affordable--drink and salad bar included. Good selection of pizza with a variety of sauces/toppings. Love the crust--crispy and not too thick. Pizza was fresh even though we came at the end of the lunch hour. New pizzas added to buffet while we were eating. Really enjoyed the breadsticks. Dessert pizza was sweet but good. Interesting atmosphere. Each booth had a tv. Not too loud though. All in all good value. We will go back. :)

<Content> So, I am a 13 year old boy, with a peanut allergy. We ordered pizza from there it is amazing, and they are allergy friendly. They also have some of the BEST bread sticks I have ever eaten.

<Content> This place is great- possibly the best pizza in town right now. I love their specialty pizzas, most notably the BLT and cheeseburger supreme pizzas.
