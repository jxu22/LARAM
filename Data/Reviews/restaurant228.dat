<Content> Went to Firehaus to watch a Seahawks game (the Bears were playing at the same time). Everything was good except our servers shift ended part way through the game and our replacement server never came to our table until i pointed out what happened.The bartender pours a bit light....but the drinks are cheap. $2 drinks on Sunday. $2 Maker's Mark and coke. Gotta love that.Food was excellent. Their Firehaus sauce stuff is amazing (i love spicy food).Service was good up until the shift change...and then it was alright after i found us a new server.Even with the shift change issue i think they get closer to 5 stars than 4.

<Content> Great venue! Handled the 500+ raving gameday fans during "Dad's Weekend" with ease. Despite blowing a keg of cider and a little wait, they eventually got our entire drink order. No small feat given the throng.Really appreciated the local fire department appreciation and decor.Next visit I'm trying the burgers.

<Content> You have to try the Jalapeo burger I think it's called the flame thrower ... oh man its so good! Ask for a cup of their BBq and some fries and you're in heaven! With it being in campus the atmosphere can dip from time to time because you get loaded with soke obnoxious college students, but over all a very enjoyable experience and good food

<Content> My husband I just left the Firehaus and we were very pleased with the service of our bartender. She was very helpful, friendly and had great customer service. In our time at the Firehaus, we observed an incompetent management team. While the bartenders became busy trying to fill orders for their servers you could see patrons at the bar with empty glasses including ourselves. Management was sitting at the end of the bar sipping on their sodas and barking orders at employees. At no time did the manager attempt to help the bartenders and clear their backlog. As we were getting ready to leave we observed a member of the management team chewing out a member of the waitstaff to where she was in tears. This was done in front of a very crowded bar for all patrons to observe. Personally, I think this is a horrible time (middle of a shift) and place (in front of a crowded bar) for a reprimand to occur.  I think their management team is extremely unprofessional and feel for the employees under their leadership.

<Content> Two words - GREAT SERVICE. Came here for lunch on a Saturday with a buddy. I ordered the Royal Burger - fried egg and bacon on a pretzel roll. The patty was homemade and delicious. However. the rolls - the pretzel roll was ...meh. Not the soft chewy consistency I expected. Based purely on food alone - I give this place 3-stars - it's average. However, it deserves an extra star for its service. For the first time (in a LONG time) I was pleasantly surprised by the attentiveness, cheerfulness, and friendliness of the restaurant staff. Emma, our server, had such a great personality!

<Content> Though all four years of being. A student here, this was my first time dining at this bar. Seeing this location not as bar for once. the set up is a lot cleaner and awesome than meets the eye. It's just like a typical sports bars with TVs everywhere following all kind of sports. Now what really attracted me today was it's deal! For $4.99 you can get 10 delicious wings that matches that if Buffalo Wild Wings! Of course, the deals do Cary day to day so you may just have to swing by the place very now and them to see if the daily special flows your boat. But when it does, boy is it worth it!The waitresses are extremely fast to react and the food also comes with speed. Their bottles and draft selection are humongous, and their prices are pretty decent too! Definitely checkout the place!

<Content> I'm a little too young to remember this place as R&R's, and I had stopped working here by the time they brought the shark bowl back, but I was one of the first employees of this place when it reopened (FINALLY) as "Firehaus" in '05.This bar took a long time to get on its feet, and by then, I was tired of not making any money due to lack of clientle, so I had moved on. But now, it's kicking ass and taking names and has a whole lot of loyal customers, and for that, I give this bar all sorts of props.Also, I just said "props." Ew.Anyway, the really excellent thing about this bar is that it is CLEAN. Clean clean clean. Even on Unofficial, which is arguably the dirtiest day on campus all year, the bathrooms at Firehaus will be clean. The layout isn't my favorite as there aren't a whole lot of places to sit, but the beer garden is excellent, and the buffalo chicken sandwich (with pasta salad!) was pretty damned good.Of all the Cochrane bars on campus, this one is without a doubt. the best.

<Content> Disclaimer: review is for their food & service, not for the nightlife.Oh Firehaus, what have they done to you since the Class of 2012 graduated and left?Maybe this place was always a little sub-par and I didn't notice or care because I was too busy drinking for free, but I swear it has gone downhill in the past couple years.This used to be my regular spot. I'd eat here probably once a week if not more and switch off between wings, salad, chicken tenders, or spinach artichoke dip. It was all amazing, every time.But sadly, my old stomping grounds have become disappointing.I came here back in May for a random visit and saw they added an AMAZING sandwich to the menu, the Southwest Chicken. Grilled chicken, provolone, pepper and onions, and avocado? YUM. Paired with onion rings and I knew this would be my new go-to on their menu.Flash forward to a couple weeks ago when I came down for Homecoming. My friends and I literally parked the car in a garage a block away and went straight to Firehaus. Ah, the nostalgia! The memories! THE GOOD FOOD!I ordered the Southwest Chicken with a side of onion rings, like I had been dreaming about all day. When it came out I was immediately disappointed to see they had replaced the fresh avocado slices with some sort of avocado PASTE. Yuck! It smelled and tasted bizarre so I scraped it off. Bye, delicious chicken sandwich! Now you are merely of slightly-above-average taste.The next day I came in for lunch, because who actually goes to Illini football games anymore? I decided to get a side salad and wings, and everyone at the table ordered a drink with their food. The waitress brought out everyone's drinks except mine, which I found strange since I had just ordered a bottle of Bud Light Platinum. After another server brought out everyone's food and not mine, I flagged down our server and the look on her face when I asked about my food was one of, "Oh shit." So she ran away and came back a couple minutes later explaining she forgot to put in my order originally. Well, duh, I kind of got that. She apologized profusely and said I'd get a discount on my bill.The wings were worth the wait, honestly, and the salad was as good as I remembered. But then the part where my bill came? No discount. At this point we were rushing off to go to another bar and my friend was nice enough to just pay for my tab, but come on. If you're going to screw up my order and then promise a discount, deliver on it.Maybe I'm just picky, or maybe I expected more from a place I used to frequent. Or maybe it lost its shine. It pains me, Firehaus, but you only get 3 stars from me.

<Content> Foods great, dance floor is severely lacking. They were like "there is no dance floor here sir, please do not do this or we'll ask you to leave" so I had to bring the party to everyone else in the bar. Didn't even finger bang anyone. Completely ruined my evening, worst campus bar for sure.

<Content> It is really hard to review a bar from your college town. The nostalgia factor gets in the way of objectivity! I've always liked Firehaus but it was never one of my haunts. I like how they have large tables, and how the front is open-air. They have lots of daily drink specials, and the atmosphere isn't sketchy. Dim lighting, very red in there. Well I guess it is a firehouse. Despite it "looking" nicer than some other campus bars (it's really just that it's newer, I'm sure), you are still going to run into some silly silly people. Last time we were here, a drunk guy was talking to us and wouldn't leave, so we took his flip flops and hid them in the girls bathroom. So you know, it's not a total class act of a bar, but it's pretty clean and well-maintaned compared to some of the other options.

<Content> I remember a time when this place was called R&R's and there was the legendary Sharkbowl. This place got a face lift and now it's called Firehaus.Now they've replaced it with the fishbowl which is a much smaller fruitier version of the sharkbowl. Oh well. There isn't much room for dancing.. but I like how there is no cover for 21+. It also is a college scene but it's one redeemable aspect is that the people are pretty good looking.

<Content> The food at Firehaus is pretty excellent. I love that you can get the burgers on pretzel buns, and the Firehaus fries are the greatest thing ever! I've never had trouble with the service either. One time, I was given the employee discount because the waitress "kept forgetting about us," but if she did, I certainly never noticed. I do wish the kitchen was open later, though.  The Firehaus fries are $3.99 on Fridays, but even though the kitchen is supposed to close at 10, if I get there past 9:30, it's already too late.I don't have too much experience with the nightlife here, but it seems pretty crowded when I go to get my fries. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you, but it was kind of a pain that I couldn't hear any of my friends from across the table. I've been there a few times earlier in the week when it's less crowded, and it's been pretty enjoyable.Last word of advice: avoid the amaretto stone sours. Unless the person making mine messed something up, it just wasn't good. It was bland and syrupy,

<Content> I dunno if it was just me and my spiritual ora while in Firehaus, but I always got hit on by a random girl on the weekends here. I felt kind of bad because I was already in a very committed relationship aka married. But really, I wasn't sending misleading creepy signals or being charming either. For the longest time I thought it was the smell of my hair wax I was using to style my bed hair when I would go out to socialize with friends. But I tested this theory numerous times in other cities and no dice. Yes, the wife was not with me at other venues.Investigatively (not a real word)... I think on certain weekends, the local gals come here to find their knight and shining armor to take them away from the small town. But here is the thing, u will never know if she is a local until she tells you. But I came here enough to observe and identify how to spot these rare and undiscovered people. First off, they are extremely beautiful, like the tone of their skin was almost natural and organic... unmanipulated by the city or fake UV rays. They dress differently, no labels and no blig. And here is the kicker, they talk differently. Their topics of discussion are not layered from the dry vocabulary of the bullshit literary material University students are being brain washed in (this includes myself). One big clue seemed to be the type of questions they asked. University girls typically asked questions like what are you studying, where have you interned, what year in school are you? But I noticed the local asked a key differentiating question: where are you originally from?---if you decode this question, it's underlying motive is can you take her away from her boring hometown.Keep in mind, this place is not swarming with these type of treasures. A treasure is a treasure to be found. I write this review because I hope to read or hear about somebody finding their future other half at Firehaus. A smart city kid that swoops a small town gal off her feet and make a ton of babies after graduating.So best wishes to you bachelors, go to Firehaus with new purpose. Cheers! I'll be expecting a wedding invitation shortly. LOL...

<Content> The Backdraft Burger at Firehaus is a campus favorite that is served with some of the best fries I've ever eaten (upgrade them to the Haus Fries and they are the best fries I've ever eaten). The Backdraft is a quarter-pound of ground chuck, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. I opted to add bacon to my burger and top it with BBQ sauce. I also subbed the house bun for a pretzel bun to kick this burger up a notch. The result is a mouthwatering combination of sauce, meat, cheese, and bun that is first-rate. If the beef was only a little more flavorful and juicy this campustown burger would be amongst some of the better I've had. Firehaus gets major points for being a campus bar that sports some gourmet grub, great drinks, and a fun atmosphere. If you're ever in home of the Illini Firehaus is a must.

<Content> Oh Firehaus. I really wish you were better, but with your normally absentminded waitresses and bartenders who on weekend nights are stuck up, how can I, really? I think that you're tolerable on Mondays, when I can kind of hear myself think, the bartenders are the new ones and not completely jaded, and I can drink cuervo silver margaritas for $3.But Firehaus, my experience with you is generally bad. The lines are ridiculous, the music is overwhelmingly loud, my friend's credit card got closed out to the wrong person, and had someone else's drinks on it... and his last name is not "Smith" or "Jones" or anything common. What You did to get on my last nerve? Once I was there, and a seasoned bartender dipped a glass in the ice bin, and it came up broken.... which means there was glass in the ice bin. I pointed it out, and so he got another glass... and dipped it back in the same ice bin with glass in it. Gross. Their food is OK, but overrated. Bah. Firehaus, I will definitely not miss you when I move away.

<Content> I love how they open up the windows when it gets warm enough and have a beer garden up top. They have good daily drink specials (Sharkbowls on Tuesdays!) and is kept very clean - and I don't just mean by campus bar standards! During the day, it's also nice to sit by the open windows and grab some chow - just your typical bar food - but it can get pretty busy, especially for lunch.I remember getting a Sharkbowl for the first time on a barcrawl with co-workers: "Uh oh, these are really yummy" =P Needless to say, the fact that Firehaus was only the second stop on our list made sure that the rest of the night was comprised of a bunch of drunken debauchery.

<Content> Sadly, not named after the 80's hair-band, nonetheless, the former R&R's has been cleaned up and they provide some pretty good pub fare. The wings are quite good. Also, I must say I was impressed with the level of service I received for Sunday brunch, after a football Saturday. If our wait person was hung-over she sure didn't show it. On time with refills and completely polite. Best part, 6 people for lunch: $50.

<Content> This place opened my last year of college and I really liked it because it was a 21 and up bar. While I didn't go to Illinois, I spent many a weekend partying down there. We loved the somewhat clean feel to Firehaus and the cheap drinks. I went back this weekend for my brothers graduation and it is now an absolute madhouse on the weekends. It's still a pretty solid place, but it has become more of your typical Champaign bar.

That is their Backdraft Burger. Don't even try to order a medium rare one. They are all cooked the same like a fast food joint. Was disappointed with their burger.As far as the bar environment I would give that three stars.

My dining partner and I thought the firefighter photography on the wall was on the depressing side, but at least it fit the motif. Our waitress was competant, and left us alone to conduct our business.My sandwhich was $7 though, and I still had to pay extra for fries. Not crazy about that.

<Content> I am soooo torn in writing this review right now!So let's break it down into two visits, one nightlife related, one evening food related.Nightlife:I came here for a friend's 21st and waited for an hour until 145 a.m. (yes, 15 min. before close) when I just said f**k it and left with my friends. Honestly, what is the point of maintaining the line that close to closing when the bar itself is not at capacity??Evening:We came here at the end of Fall semester as an organization to celebrate a job well done. Our group of 10 was seated promptly and the waitress did an awesome job in accommodating our group. We came on a Thursday I think which meant $3 burger with AMAZINGGGGGG fries. Their fries are double fried so they have a great crispy crust. On top of that, they have a good selection of beer on tap to complement your meal. Expect to pay more for a pint than for your entire meal haha.So it's quite bittersweet... awesome bar food place turned horrible bar at night? This is life :(

<Content> I remember the Wednesday nights I spent here with a paint-pen decorated mug in my hand or clutching one of the many straws poking out of a Shark Bowl. Of course it was R&R's back then...After being under construction for something like 17 years, it finally re-opened after I moved to Chicago. I came here before a football game last year and was pretty impressed. Out with the rickety wooden stairs and graffiti-filled bathroom. In with the shiny photos of firefighters and giant hydrants of beer. 3 cheers for hydrants of beer!! The decor was crisp and basic, which is appropriate for a campus bar where drunken kleptomaniacs will nab anything that isn't nailed down. Apparently, you must be 21 to enter after 9pm so they are going for an older crowd. I highly recommend this place if you're an alum and hitting up Chambana for a sporting event.

You can find me here for lunch dates with my bff for their fried chicken salad with blue cheese and a side of their homemade fries... mmm so delicious! Recently they have introduced $4 40's... which I pray they will continue through the school year, not just the summer! The balcony is always nice on a summer evening. Of course this place gets packed... what campus bar doesn't? But if I had to pick a bar to wait in line for, it'd be this one.

The decor is nice and eye-catching though. I will go when I'm in town just to reminisce about it's predecessor and those addictive shark bowls with the plastic squeaky shark...ok, now I'm just rambling, sorry!

Food is standard bar food, the drinks are alright, I just hate having to track down people to get a simple order of a few beers. I'd hate to see what it looks like when it's really busy.

<Content> For Champaign, this is one of the better places. It has some of the best bar food in campus town and some of the specials are decent. For example, Fridays they have $4 forties and $4 Firehaus fries which are spectacular. It's one of my favorite bars in Champaign.

<Content> Decent bar food, decent beer. I like to go here early for lunch since service is faster and it hasn't gotten too loud yet. Don't expect anything very healthy here..there are a few salads and a veggie wrap, but all have cheese or dressing (which I guess you could get on the side...). Onion rings are good, I've heard the mac-n-cheese is tasty, and many of the burgers are on wonderful pretzel rolls. As a note, they have something called "haus sauce", which is just their buffalo sauce, so don't be fooled. Never been here during peak evening hours, so I can't comment on that, but an ok place for lunch and a beer.

<Content> Met a friend for lunch here one day. Decent place. Not too crowded for a campus town spot. At the suggestion of my friend, I opted for the Nacho plate. Huge serving and it was quite good. Everything is firehouse themed, as far as the menu is concerned and so many of the burgers and sandwiches and wraps sounded delicious. Will have to go again sometime and try one. Service was quick and friendly.

<Content> Best bar food in campus town. I always get battalian burger. The bartender's here are fantastic. I really love the service here and I always come here with friends when they visit. I feel the negative service complaints may be from wiper packed weekends like dads weekend or homecoming where every bar will be backed up. I love this bar and many of my college memories came from here

<Content> I like how this place looks from the outside. The open-air front is inviting and makes you want to hang out there. But it's a different experience inside. First of all, it seemed dirty. Maybe I was just there on a bad night, but it looked like the floors hadn't been mopped in weeks. Then there's the service, which was terrible. Very long waits to buy a drink. We didn't eat so I can't rate the food, but my overall impression of the place was that there are better places in Champaign to hang out.
